Usually, when I see ""student project"" and ""free"" I'll usually pass it over.  Often times these free games perform very poorly and look kind of rubbish.  NOT THIS ONE.

The art style is consistent and terribly charming.  It's actually quite light-hearted, which masks the really dark undercurrent of the game:  you are playing a werewolf, who will easily, if not cheerfully, murder anybody who looks at him funny and then snarfle the corpse like a BBQ brochette.

That tension defines the game:  you're a janitor who, for corporate dystopian rules, is obliged to work at night while transformed.  Other workers are also there.  You need to still clean those messes, but you need to not be seen while doing it, so you become a stealth-janitor, skulking about, trying to avoid being seen so you don't have to silence witnesses (and then eat them to conceal the evidence).  The game will reward you with a tiny medal if you can get through an evening without murder, but... eh, who's going to miss an office drone or two, anyway?

I quite like a stealth game, and good ones have opponents who don't just walk around predictably in squares with convenient pauses - those games are geometry problems.  People here are more believable, meandering to do various tasks.  But, in a nod towards good UI in gameplay, a little timer appears over their head telling you how long you have before they do something else, which lets you decide if it's worth chancing going for that hallway, or waiting to see where that person goes next.

So, to recap:  the art style is remarkably cheerful, and apart from the excessively juicy transformation noise, it's not really gruesome either.  (Okay, consuming a corpse leaves big red splashes and what my wife would call ""squiggly spooges"" on the ground; they're more like pink corkscrews than internal organs).  If these guys actually tried to sell this game, I'd've actually bought it, and I can't think of any higher praise than that.  I don't even plan on pushing my gaming-adjacent stuff much at all here, that's how highly I hold this in regard.  (But do look at my profile if you'd be so kind.)

You play as Kyle, an office janitor at day and a werewolf at night. And being a werewolf won't pay your rent, so you still have to clean others mess and try to not make even more mess. Apparently everyone works in the office at night, so you'll have to be sneaky. Or not. Noone is gonna look for their bodies anyway :)

Great soundtrack, very cute artstyle, fun gameplay. It's pretty short though, but it's alright, still worth playing. Pretty challenging to go for 100%, but not too hard. There's a little bug, when clerks can detect me with their ass somehow, but it's not critical

You play as Kyle, an exceptional cleaner who takes great pride in his work. Everything seems perfectly ordinary… [b] UNTIL [/b] the full moon rises and you transform into a werewolf! To make matters worse, your boss Daryl switches your shifts to the night. You’ll need to hide your secret from him at all costs, what could possibly go wrong ?!

The WereCleaner is a fun and wonderfully silly game with seven levels, all set in the same workplace called Howlin’ Hugs. As you progress, new doors unlock and fresh areas become available to clean. Since you’re working nights, you’ll need to avoid the other employees (and especially Daryl!) so they don’t discover your furry secret… or, if you’re feeling mischievous, you can simply eat them all!!!

Each level is a blend of chaos and comedy as you juggle cleaning up messes while trying to stay hidden. The gameplay loop is simple yet entertaining, and there’s plenty of charm packed into every shift.

The game is free, funny, light-hearted, and great fun from start to finish. The short story is amusing, and it’s also quite easy to 100% perfect for achievement hunters looking for a quick laugh. I encountered no bugs or issues during my playthrough, which makes the experience even smoother.

Don’t get caught, werewolves! 💀🍖

Yes, it’s short (only 7 levels), but it’s packed with personality, solid design, and genuinely great comedy.

The premise is simple, but it’s executed really well: you’re basically trying to do your job while things are… messy. The levels are quick, focused, and never feel like filler. Everything feels intentional, and the game doesn’t waste your time. Instead, it keeps throwing little surprises at you, and the humor stays consistent throughout.

What really stood out to me is how polished it feels for such a short experience. The presentation works, the gameplay is straightforward but satisfying, and the pacing is excellent. It’s the kind of game you can finish in one sitting and walk away thinking, “That was totally worth it.”

Also: there’s a bit of blood, so keep that in mind. It’s not extreme, but it’s definitely part of the vib, so if you’re okay with that, you’ll probably have a great time.

And the ending… I won’t spoil anything, but it was genuinely hilarious and made the whole thing even more memorable.

With that being said, it has an interesting idea executed efficiently. Each level has you sneaking through an office complex, and cleaning up bizarre mess scattered in various rooms. The latter is mechanically sterile and mundane, making stealth the obvious meat of the experience. I think that if the game were a little longer, the “cleaning part” would have struck out as even more monotonous, especially on replays. This is where I should also talk about the music. I believe that one major purpose of music in any video game is to hide this monotony, this purpose could not be achieved here. The game plays a single track, for every one of its levels, which becomes somewhat unpleasant to listen to after a while. 

It also throws a few extra variables to splice things up, but due to its short length, it is not able to give enough time for them to marinate. Moreover, I found the “blindfold” to be somewhat random in how well it worked. Regardless, I feel that this is an excellent foundation to build upon.

[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]

[h3]Visuals[/h3]
[i]The WereCleaner[/i] uses 3D visuals, but they are deformed so much that they end up looking cute, especially the main character. Moreover, the environment is also made to match it. Despite the game showing blood and organs, the presentation doesn't make it look horrible because of this.

[h3]Story[/h3]
The story is mostly told in the form of dialogues that are shown in each level and cutscenes after a few levels. The former will be full of dialogue between you and the security guard who is guarding the office where you work. The latter will be done without dialogues—it will be done in the animation format without any text. The animation looks cute, and the dialogue isn't boring to read.

[h3]The Game[/h3]
[b]Gameplay[/b]
You are a janitor. Your job is to clean up messes. The game will place the location of the messes that you have to clean on the map, so you just need to go there, clean the mess, and exit the office. You are armed with two weapons at first: the vacuum will suck all trash, while the powerwasher will clean all the stains. The game spans seven levels of varying difficulty.

Well, you are also a werewolf. People don't like werewolves. You eat people since you can't control your instinct. The solution? Clean the messes without being seen. You need to avoid people looking at you—the game has some leniency as long as you don't get too close, although since you need to go fast, sometimes it can be hard to react quickly if someone is looking at you in the direction you are walking.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3360664876 

Despite only being set in an office, each level still feels unique. The office was big, and the game made it so that you can only access a certain part of the office at the first few levels, and then start introducing new areas and/or incorporating them with old ones. You need to figure out where the area is that most people are going to and avoid going there if possible. Later on, there will be another way to help you not get seen, although the execution can be hard to do since you need to be close to them.

Killing people isn't the end. You'll get the option to move the body or eat it, which will require you to clean. Leaving the body as it is will be hard to do since people will find it and then go into panic. Moreover, eating the body can take a longer time since you also need to clean the mess, making it faster to just restart the game if you aim for a perfect score.

https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3256605529 

Each level will be graded. There are 5 stars and a no-kill mark. You can get both at the same run or do it separately—they will only save your best progress. Getting five stars requires you to finish the level quickly, while the no-kill rule is exactly as it says. If this isn't enough, the game also has collectibles every few levels to amp the challenge.

[b]Length and Difficulty[/b]
I finished the game in 1.8h. I had to replay some levels several times to get five stars and no-kill in each level for some achievements. As for the difficulty, it is easy to beat if you don't mind the optional stuff, although the game will increase in difficulty if you try to get the five stars and no-kill mark.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
[i]The WereCleaner[/i] is such a cute stealth game. The levels are enjoyable, and the gameplay is easy to learn. The game might be short, but there is still a lot of content in it. If you enjoy both stealth and cleaning games, this is the perfect game for you.",76561198132503739,779,728,106,0,106,2025-08-02T18:43:20+00:00

The art style is cute and it does not take itself very seriously. So an absolute recommendation from my side.

[h2] The game [/h2]
The game itself does have a great gameplay loop and adds different things incrementally. So the learning curve was great.
The stealth with the speed of the character make it fun to play over and over just to get the stars/no kills.

But the game is quite short and fast to play through. Getting all the achievements is also not the hardest thing.

[h2] Polish [/h2]
This game is quite polished and the art does guide the player very well through the experience. This game feels finished and plays nicely. But I have some nitpicks in this department:
[olist]
   [*] The game shows the information that you have the ability to switch tools in the first level whilst not being able to switch.
   [*] A little point about performance that I am going to talk about in the ""Performance"" section.
   [*] At least for me, it seemed like the detection is a little bit variable. Sometimes they do not see you, even though they should have (and you are quite thankful) and sometimes they detect you instantly. And in this case I do not mean that when they are working, they do not really seem to detect you (except you are directly in their sight) but more or less that sometimes they detect you instantly around the corner and in other scenarios you can run in front of them, put a bag on them and then act like nothing happened.
   [*] You can easily get stuck at corners if you run near to the wall. This does [b]not[/b] happen very often as the spaces are large enough, but if it happens it is extremely annoying. Thankfully this is quite rare.
   [*] When the player is in the menu where you select the level, your selection is automatically placed on the ""Home Menu"" Button. And if you want to go to the first item you have to go right and cannot go to the bottom. This is just a tiny nitpick, but it annoyed me enough to be in this list.
[/olist]

But just to reiterate. These are just nitpicks and are nothing major. So this game is extremely polished and feels great.

[h2] Performance [/h2]
I myself didn't have any real performance issues. I have read in the forums about some people having extreme lags, but this wasn't the case on my devices and most people seem not to have any performance problems.
But it still seems like sometimes if you are in a level and something gets loaded, the game does not keep up with the framerate and gets a little bit stuttery. This is not problematic, but it was a little bit annoying.

But I have to note that this game ran smoothly 99% of the time and I never had any major performance problems.

[h2] TL;DR [/h2]
This game is amazing and that this game is free is another reason to get this game now. It does not take long to play trough and even though there are some small critiques, the game itself is fantastic.",76561198822688892,151,3,140,0,140,2025-02-20T14:16:40+00:00

[h2]保安？只是我狼的绿帽奴^ ^[/h2]

游戏中最令人印象深刻的一定是门口那位和蔼可亲的保安
他隔着厚墙全然不知屋内发生了什么，颇有一种被灯下黑戴绿帽的苦主风范
不管是第一天满心欢喜地期待惊喜发生的星星眼
还是一步步陷入深度怀疑、内耗
再到开始诈唬主角，最后黑化掏出双管猎枪追杀主角
都为本该繁琐的小游戏带来了不一样的色彩
而射坏替身眼里难以掩盖的悲伤与疲惫更是让角色的塑造更为饱满
在剧情这一块把玩家拿捏得死死的www

[h2]人兽两隔，是世间最遥远的距离[/h2]

门口的保安就像是我最熟悉的陌生人，我们之间的距离仅有一墙之隔，原来他都知道...他的心中还是有我的...
久别一日，我知道他是多么渴望与我相见，从他 [b]粗大的双管猎枪[/b] 不难看出，我们之间的情谊是多么的深厚。
他像极了 [b]黑化的西园寺世界[/b] （日在校园女主）提刀向我奔来...

不过抱歉了，兄弟
我无法接受你 [b]炽烈的爱[/b]
就算得到 [b]我的身体[/b]
也无法得到 [b]我的心[/b]
你是 [b]碧桂园五星上将[/b]
而我是只 [b]付不起房租的狼[/b]
你拖着疲惫不堪的身体向我 [b]靠近[/b]
猛烈的射击却只会 [b]拉远[/b] 我们间的距离
我仅是想要一个温暖的 [b]拥抱[/b]
而并非是作为你倾 [b]泻火[/b] 力的玩具

再见了， [b]福瑞控大叔[/b]
我们 [b]人兽两隔[/b] ，这是世上最遥远的距离
我将要去往远方，只有那里才有狼自由奔跑的草甸

但愿故地重游，还能再听见你的声音/ᐠﹷ ‸ ﹷ ᐟ\ﾉ

[h2]Overview[/h2]
Super cute, funny little stealth game! You have to clean various rooms in the office while avoiding your co-workers, lest they find out you're a werewolf... But don't worry; if someone sees you, you can k!ll them and get rid of the bodies. This, however, takes time, and you're constantly in a hurry... Getting the max points (5 stars + no k!lls) in every level (7 levels total) can be somewhat challenging, forcing you to optimize your path around the office and decide wether it's more time efficient sneaking around or murdering whoever stands in your path and clean the mess later. It's so much fun.

[h2]Key Points[/h2]
[*][h3] DIFFICULTY:[/h3] Casual-hard. Some strategy is required to 100% it.

[*][h3] STORY:[/h3] Silly premise, silly dialogue, lovely.
[*][h3] GAMEPLAY/GAMEPLAY LOOP:[/h3] 7 increasingly challenging levels; it's basically a stealth mini-game.
[*][h3] TECHNICAL POLISH:[/h3] I haven't encountered any glitches or bugs.
[*][h3] MONEYxCONTENT VALUE:[/h3] It could EASILY be sold for 1-2 bucks, but it's free, so just download it and have a good time for a couple hours!",76561199851789306,39,24,193,193,193,2026-01-25T21:57:20+00:00

Despite being very short, roughly taking 1-2 hours to play to completion, it finds a way to challenge you with each level. I really like how the game builds on itself to introduce new mechanics and challenges with each night. At no point does it feel like their is as huge challenge curve, rather increasing the amount of coworkers you may encounter at each turn. The length of each level is quite generous, with more than enough time for one to complete them, even if you end up eating a coworker or two to keep your cover.

In terms of the storytelling and attention to details, I must give the game devs props for keeping things humorous and cute. The art style definitely compliments the overall storytelling, which takes on a sateric and comedic take on minimum wage jobs, which in this case is a janitorial position. Despite being cursed as a werewolf he continues to work, despite putting his coworkers at risk of being his dinner just to pay rent.

Overall, this game deserves a quick play, and can be a great game night choice with a duo or with friends.

tl;dr -> Quircky and comedic game that is simplistic and easy to learn, challenge is curved but fair, great game to play with friends and is free to play!",76561198372714577,98,20,83,0,83,2025-07-30T17:09:32+00:00

The art style is cute, the story (while short) is also cute. Just a very cute and fun game.

i went into this thinking it would just be a mid game, and HOLY was i proven wrong quickly.
the animation while simple and small, is very smooth.
the songs are quite good, and trying to stay out of sight proved to be quite a challenge, and if i did get found, well...


no wittnesses.

the collectable discriptions gave a chuckle or two.
i like the premese of the game. its very simple, but i still like it.
this game has some commedy here and there, and the ending? i wont spoil the ending, but i was suprised.
and one of the best parts? the game is free.
having put so much effort yet the game is free actully feels a bit ilegal.

If I had to criticise anything, I think the 2D cutscenes could've used a bit more polish. I felt it was a bit rushed and not as well done as the 3D stuff. Also, I bet most people missed out a bunch of story because levels transition between eachother without being returned to the menu (I reckon it'd be a good idea); each level has a description that you gotta go out of your way to read.

It was a pretty fun and rewarding achievement hunt as well. Didn't notice any bugs or anything. It'd be nice if the timer showed the current star grade; you CAN read what the next star rating's time limit is, but the times are different for each level.

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

This game is the perfect blend of cozy and chaotic. You play as an adorable werewolf just trying to do your job—cleaning an office. Sounds wholesome, right? Well… as long as no one sees you. If they do? Let’s just say there’s a bit of cartoon-style gore.

The art is absolutely charming—super well-drawn, adorable and fluid animations, and an aesthetic that feels cute enough to be in an anime… until someone walks in and suddenly there's blood on the office plants. But even the “gory” parts are playful and over-the-top in a cartoony way.

Gameplay-wise, it’s a cozy loop of cleaning, sneaking, and making sure no one catches you being your fluffy, fangy self. It’s weirdly relaxing, a little mischievous, and genuinely funny in a ""did I really just eat a guy in a tie?"" kind of way.

Totally free, wonderfully unique, and perfect for fans of quirky indie games with a dark sense of humor wrapped in a warm, fuzzy art style.

Highly recommend! Just… maybe don’t get caught. 🐾",76561198143194289,139,6,96,0,51,2025-11-25T21:45:48+00:00

Welcome to The WereCleaner - a game that answers the age-old question:

    “What if lycanthropy came with a mop?”

Gameplay-wise, it’s like someone mixed PowerWash Simulator, a horror game, and a budget werewolf movie, then said,
“You get 15 minutes. Make it count.”

I loved it.
But also? I blinked and it was over.
It’s so short, I actually re-launched it to check if I accidentally skipped the other 90% of the game. Spoiler: I did not.
This isn’t Early Access. This is Early-Accessory.

That being said, the vibes are immaculate:
✅ You clean spooky things
✅ You turn into a hairy beast
✅ You probably still get paid minimum wage

The ending left me emotionally devastated and also hungry for more. Like… you gave me half a sandwich and told me it was a banquet.

Please, devs. I beg you.

The WereCleaner is an absolute hidden gem that brilliantly blends horror, humor, and surprisingly heartfelt storytelling. Imagine scrubbing away supernatural filth in abandoned buildings while slowly unraveling a mystery that’s part lycanthropy, part existential dread, and entirely captivating. It’s like if Viscera Cleanup Detail went on a full moon bender and came back with lore, fangs, and a moral compass.

🎮 Gameplay Highlights:

Addictively satisfying clean-up mechanics with just the right touch of chaos

A transformation mechanic that turns you into the were-cleaner during critical moments (yes, it’s as awesome as it sounds)

Deep narrative woven into gritty messes—every bloodstain tells a story

Unexpectedly charming NPCs and some hauntingly beautiful level design

✨ What Stands Out: The attention to detail is incredible—from the eerie sound design to the tiny clues hidden in grime. It’s a love letter to both horror fans and neat freaks, and somehow manages to make cleaning feel heroic and thrilling.

If you’ve ever wanted a game that lets you fight darkness with elbow grease and fangs, The WereCleaner is your new obsession. More werewolves, more mop handles, more meaning—yes please.",76561198385355111,334,4,132,0,132,2024-10-07T01:43:59+00:00
