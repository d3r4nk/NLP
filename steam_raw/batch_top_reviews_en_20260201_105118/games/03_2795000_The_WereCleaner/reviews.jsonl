Often times these free games perform very poorly and look kind of rubbish.  NOT THIS ONE.\r\n\r\nThe art style is consistent and terribly charming.  It's actually quite light-hearted, which masks the really dark undercurrent of the game:  you are playing a werewolf, who will easily, if not cheerfully, murder anybody who looks at him funny and then snarfle the corpse like a BBQ brochette.\r\n\r\nThat tension defines the game:  you're a janitor who, for corporate dystopian rules, is obliged to work at night while transformed.  Other workers are also there.  You need to still clean those messes, but you need to not be seen while doing it, so you become a stealth-janitor, skulking about, trying to avoid being seen so you don't have to silence witnesses (and then eat them to conceal the evidence).  The game will reward you with a tiny medal if you can get through an evening without murder, but... eh, who's going to miss an office drone or two, anyway?\r\n\r\nI quite like a stealth game, and good ones have opponents who don't just walk around predictably in squares with convenient pauses - those games are geometry problems.  People here are more believable, meandering to do various tasks.  But, in a nod towards good UI in gameplay, a little timer appears over their head telling you how long you have before they do something else, which lets you decide if it's worth chancing going for that hallway, or waiting to see where that person goes next.\r\n\r\nSo, to recap:  the art style is remarkably cheerful, and apart from the excessively juicy transformation noise, it's not really gruesome either.  (Okay, consuming a corpse leaves big red splashes and what my wife would call \"squiggly spooges\" on the ground; they're more like pink corkscrews than internal organs).  If these guys actually tried to sell this game, I'd've actually bought it, and I can't think of any higher praise than that.  I don't even plan on pushing my gaming-adjacent stuff much at all here, that's how highly I hold this in regard.  (But do look at my profile if you'd be so kind.)\r\n\r\nIt's free, it's pretty good.

Everything seems perfectly ordinary… [b] UNTIL [/b] the full moon rises and you transform into a werewolf! To make matters worse, your boss Daryl switches your shifts to the night. You’ll need to hide your secret from him at all costs, what could possibly go wrong ?!\n\nThe WereCleaner is a fun and wonderfully silly game with seven levels, all set in the same workplace called Howlin’ Hugs. As you progress, new doors unlock and fresh areas become available to clean. Since you’re working nights, you’ll need to avoid the other employees (and especially Daryl!) so they don’t discover your furry secret… or, if you’re feeling mischievous, you can simply eat them all!!!\n\nEach level is a blend of chaos and comedy as you juggle cleaning up messes while trying to stay hidden. The gameplay loop is simple yet entertaining, and there’s plenty of charm packed into every shift.\n\nThe game is free, funny, light-hearted, and great fun from start to finish. The short story is amusing, and it’s also quite easy to 100% perfect for achievement hunters looking for a quick laugh. I encountered no bugs or issues during my playthrough, which makes the experience even smoother.\n\nDon’t get caught, werewolves! 💀🍖\n\n[quote]Tip: If you want to find more reviews like this, check out our curator page [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/41527689/]Moon's Tea House[/url][/quote]", "author_steamid": "76561198219237777", "author_num_games_owned": 283, "author_num_reviews": 50, "author_playtime_forever": 164, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 151, "author_last_played": "2025-10-17T14:15:48+00:00"}

The presentation works, the gameplay is straightforward but satisfying, and the pacing is excellent. It’s the kind of game you can finish in one sitting and walk away thinking, “That was totally worth it.”\n\nAlso: there’s a bit of blood, so keep that in mind. It’s not extreme, but it’s definitely part of the vib, so if you’re okay with that, you’ll probably have a great time.\n\nAnd the ending… I won’t spoil anything, but it was genuinely hilarious and made the whole thing even more memorable.\n\nIf you like short games with a strong concept and good humor, I absolutely recommend The Werecleaner.", "author_steamid": "76561199035513907", "author_num_games_owned": 131, "author_num_reviews": 13, "author_playtime_forever": 280, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 280, "author_last_played": "2025-12-16T18:04:11+00:00"}

With that being said, it has an interesting idea executed efficiently. Each level has you sneaking through an office complex, and cleaning up bizarre mess scattered in various rooms. The latter is mechanically sterile and mundane, making stealth the obvious meat of the experience. I think that if the game were a little longer, the “cleaning part” would have struck out as even more monotonous, especially on replays. This is where I should also talk about the music. I believe that one major purpose of music in any video game is to hide this monotony, this purpose could not be achieved here. The game plays a single track, for every one of its levels, which becomes somewhat unpleasant to listen to after a while. \r\n\r\nIt also throws a few extra variables to splice things up, but due to its short length, it is not able to give enough time for them to marinate. Moreover, I found the “blindfold” to be somewhat random in how well it worked. Regardless, I feel that this is an excellent foundation to build upon.\r\n", "author_steamid": "76561198989729683", "author_num_games_owned": 192, "author_num_reviews": 66, "author_playtime_forever": 48, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 48, "author_last_played": "2025-03-29T04:22:40+00:00"}

The game has 7 levels in total.\n\n[b]Pros:[/b]\n- 7 levels\n- Various mechanics to keep you entertained\n\n[b]Cons:[/b]\n- It can be hard to see people who are outside the screen that is looking in your direction\n\n[b]Specs[/b]\n[url=https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck]Steam Deck[/url]: AMD Zen 2 4c/8t 2.4-3.5GHz, 16 GB RAM, 8 AMD RDNA 2 CUs\n\n[h1]Should you play this game?[/h1]\n[i]If you enjoy stealth and cleaning, this game is for you.[/i]\n\n[hr][/hr]\n[h1]In-Depth Review[/h1]\n\n[h3]Visuals[/h3]\n[i]The WereCleaner[/i] uses 3D visuals, but they are deformed so much that they end up looking cute, especially the main character. Moreover, the environment is also made to match it. Despite the game showing blood and organs, the presentation doesn't make it look horrible because of this.\n\n[h3]Story[/h3]\nThe story is mostly told in the form of dialogues that are shown in each level and cutscenes after a few levels. The former will be full of dialogue between you and the security guard who is guarding the office where you work. The latter will be done without dialogues—it will be done in the animation format without any text. The animation looks cute, and the dialogue isn't boring to read.\n\n[h3]The Game[/h3]\n[b]Gameplay[/b]\nYou are a janitor. Your job is to clean up messes. The game will place the location of the messes that you have to clean on the map, so you just need to go there, clean the mess, and exit the office. You are armed with two weapons at first: the vacuum will suck all trash, while the powerwasher will clean all the stains. The game spans seven levels of varying difficulty.\n\nWell, you are also a werewolf. People don't like werewolves. You eat people since you can't control your instinct. The solution? Clean the messes without being seen. You need to avoid people looking at you—the game has some leniency as long as you don't get too close, although since you need to go fast, sometimes it can be hard to react quickly if someone is looking at you in the direction you are walking.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3360664876 \n\nDespite only being set in an office, each level still feels unique. The office was big, and the game made it so that you can only access a certain part of the office at the first few levels, and then start introducing new areas and/or incorporating them with old ones. You need to figure out where the area is that most people are going to and avoid going there if possible. Later on, there will be another way to help you not get seen, although the execution can be hard to do since you need to be close to them.\n\nKilling people isn't the end. You'll get the option to move the body or eat it, which will require you to clean. Leaving the body as it is will be hard to do since people will find it and then go into panic. Moreover, eating the body can take a longer time since you also need to clean the mess, making it faster to just restart the game if you aim for a perfect score.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3256605529 \n\nEach level will be graded. There are 5 stars and a no-kill mark. You can get both at the same run or do it separately—they will only save your best progress. Getting five stars requires you to finish the level quickly, while the no-kill rule is exactly as it says. If this isn't enough, the game also has collectibles every few levels to amp the challenge.\n\n[b]Length and Difficulty[/b]\nI finished the game in 1.8h. I had to replay some levels several times to get five stars and no-kill in each level for some achievements. As for the difficulty, it is easy to beat if you don't mind the optional stuff, although the game will increase in difficulty if you try to get the five stars and no-kill mark.\n\n[h1]Conclusion[/h1]\n[i]The WereCleaner[/i] is such a cute stealth game. The levels are enjoyable, and the gameplay is easy to learn. The game might be short, but there is still a lot of content in it. If you enjoy both stealth and cleaning games, this is the perfect game for you.", "author_steamid": "76561198132503739", "author_num_games_owned": 779, "author_num_reviews": 728, "author_playtime_forever": 106, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 106, "author_last_played": "2025-08-02T18:43:20+00:00"}

This game is simple whilst also engaging. The art style is cute and it does not take itself very seriously. So an absolute recommendation from my side.\n\n[h2] The game [/h2]\nThe game itself does have a great gameplay loop and adds different things incrementally. So the learning curve was great.\nThe stealth with the speed of the character make it fun to play over and over just to get the stars/no kills.\n\nBut the game is quite short and fast to play through. Getting all the achievements is also not the hardest thing.\n\n[h2] Polish [/h2]\nThis game is quite polished and the art does guide the player very well through the experience. This game feels finished and plays nicely. But I have some nitpicks in this department:\n[olist]\n   [*] The game shows the information that you have the ability to switch tools in the first level whilst not being able to switch.\n   [*] A little point about performance that I am going to talk about in the \"Performance\" section.\n   [*] At least for me, it seemed like the detection is a little bit variable. Sometimes they do not see you, even though they should have (and you are quite thankful) and sometimes they detect you instantly. And in this case I do not mean that when they are working, they do not really seem to detect you (except you are directly in their sight) but more or less that sometimes they detect you instantly around the corner and in other scenarios you can run in front of them, put a bag on them and then act like nothing happened.\n   [*] You can easily get stuck at corners if you run near to the wall. This does [b]not[/b] happen very often as the spaces are large enough, but if it happens it is extremely annoying. Thankfully this is quite rare.\n   [*] When the player is in the menu where you select the level, your selection is automatically placed on the \"Home Menu\" Button. And if you want to go to the first item you have to go right and cannot go to the bottom. This is just a tiny nitpick, but it annoyed me enough to be in this list.\n[/olist]\n\nBut just to reiterate. These are just nitpicks and are nothing major. So this game is extremely polished and feels great.\n\n[h2] Performance [/h2]\nI myself didn't have any real performance issues. I have read in the forums about some people having extreme lags, but this wasn't the case on my devices and most people seem not to have any performance problems.\nBut it still seems like sometimes if you are in a level and something gets loaded, the game does not keep up with the framerate and gets a little bit stuttery. This is not problematic, but it was a little bit annoying.\n\nBut I have to note that this game ran smoothly 99% of the time and I never had any major performance problems.\n\n[h2] TL;DR [/h2]\nThis game is amazing and that this game is free is another reason to get this game now. It does not take long to play trough and even though there are some small critiques, the game itself is fantastic.", "author_steamid": "76561198822688892", "author_num_games_owned": 151, "author_num_reviews": 3, "author_playtime_forever": 140, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 140, "author_last_played": "2025-02-20T14:16:40+00:00"}

At no point does it feel like their is as huge challenge curve, rather increasing the amount of coworkers you may encounter at each turn. The length of each level is quite generous, with more than enough time for one to complete them, even if you end up eating a coworker or two to keep your cover.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the storytelling and attention to details, I must give the game devs props for keeping things humorous and cute.

Despite being cursed as a werewolf he continues to work, despite putting his coworkers at risk of being his dinner just to pay rent.\r\n\r\nOverall, this game deserves a quick play, and can be a great game night choice with a duo or with friends.\r\n\r\ntl;dr -> Quircky and comedic game that is simplistic and easy to learn, challenge is curved but fair, great game to play with friends and is free to play!", "author_steamid": "76561198372714577", "author_num_games_owned": 98, "author_num_reviews": 20, "author_playtime_forever": 83, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 83, "author_last_played": "2025-07-30T17:09:32+00:00"}

Oops, I Ate My Boss 💼💀\n\n⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐\n\nThis game is the perfect blend of cozy and chaotic. You play as an adorable werewolf just trying to do your job—cleaning an office. Sounds wholesome, right? Well… as long as no one sees you. If they do? Let’s just say there’s a bit of cartoon-style gore.\n\nThe art is absolutely charming—super well-drawn, adorable and fluid animations, and an aesthetic that feels cute enough to be in an anime… until someone walks in and suddenly there's blood on the office plants. But even the “gory” parts are playful and over-the-top in a cartoony way.\n\nGameplay-wise, it’s a cozy loop of cleaning, sneaking, and making sure no one catches you being your fluffy, fangy self. It’s weirdly relaxing, a little mischievous, and genuinely funny in a \"did I really just eat a guy in a tie?\" kind of way.\n\nTotally free, wonderfully unique, and perfect for fans of quirky indie games with a dark sense of humor wrapped in a warm, fuzzy art style.\n\nHighly recommend!

If there was any future stuff added then I will definitely come back to have more! There were a few moments that did lag and performance not that well, but only a small amount so it wasn't that much of an issue at all, also had some frustrating moments with getting caught though I'm sure that was just me having bad timing. The story is cute yet kinda sad when thinking about it, the achievements were very fun to get and weren't that much of a challenge except getting five stars on all levels was a little hard until I learned the patterns and movements of the NPCs. Overall a great cute game that I really want more of!

Spoiler: I did not.\nThis isn’t Early Access. This is Early-Accessory.\n\nThat being said, the vibes are immaculate:\n✅ You clean spooky things\n✅ You turn into a hairy beast\n✅ You probably still get paid minimum wage\n\nThe ending left me emotionally devastated and also hungry for more. Like… you gave me half a sandwich and told me it was a banquet.\n\nPlease, devs. I beg you.\nMake more. Add more. Remaster this, remake it, WERE-CLEANSE it.\n(Detroit: Become Human got a full game.

It’s a love letter to both horror fans and neat freaks, and somehow manages to make cleaning feel heroic and thrilling.\n\nIf you’ve ever wanted a game that lets you fight darkness with elbow grease and fangs, The WereCleaner is your new obsession.
