An absolutely STUNNING little game that scratched an itch I forgot I even had, a huge throwback to my childhood days playing point-and-click gems like Putt-Putt and Pajama Sam. Poco captures that same whimsical, exploratory magic but gives it a delightfully modern, slightly twisted spin.

Every character you meet oozes personality, and the world? It's a visual treat packed with little offbeat, macabre touches that walk the perfect line between eerie and endearing.

And the soundtrack? Absolute perfection. A whole vibe. Like a warm hug wrapped in a little mystery. Chef’s kiss.

This game didn’t just exceed my expectations; it reminded me why I fell in love with games in the first place.

Gameplay hits that perfect sweet spot of fun puzzles and exploration, not too easy but satisfying to figure out and the world is packed with fun little moments and lovable homunculi that help make Poco’s journey feel meaningful. 

The only “complaint” (if you can call it that) is that I wish there was more. More story, more world, more adventures. The ending left me wanting a sequel or continuation so badly because this world is just too delightful not to revisit!

You do a heft amount of pointing, a solid amount of clicking, and a story that is a mix of Little Big Adventure, Pajama Sam and Beautiful Darkness (that one story where little people escape a dead body and start rummaging through the forest, the game too has a rotting clown skeleton present, so I don't know how much child friendly is it, but kids should be more thicker skinned these days anyway) 

There's a scene of a dead insect present, but you compose a song in its honor, you also cold bloodily murder a worm, so I don't know how to justify that one besides giving Poco the bad ending so he repents for his sins.

Also, the soundtrack is really good and dynamic between rooms, the motive has weird The Residents kick to it, who also were clowncore composers, just compare the two.

Poco is a cute, if bizarre, hand-drawn point & click puzzle game, in a similar vein as games from the Rusty Lake Series or by Madison Karrh.

In this game, you play as the titular character who is trying to return to the circus after being kicked out. To solve your dilemma, you must engage with some peculiar characters and be innovative in the use of the materials you come across as you explore.

The game features absolutely beautiful art and a high-key bop of a soundtrack. I wasn't expecting the latter based on the trailer/screenshots, but was solidly impressed by it.

The only things I take issue with is that some of the solutions are a bit obscure. The game has a hint system, but I avoided using it, so maybe that would have solved my concern, but I also don't like feeling like I need to use hints to progress. For a free game of this quality, it's difficult to complain about the length, but this felt like it could have easily been 2-3x the length and been stronger for it.

This game was so well put together with an obvious amount of love. SO much love that I teared up at multiple points! Poco is the cutest little clown with the bravest heart. The game is a wonderful mix of claymation and something else i cant quite name.

Onto what i really wanna talk about hehe! The game had me smiling all the way through! The characters were well defined and original. You could really tell them apart by how they acted and not just by how they looked. I came to love them all, even ones i didn't originally like, like Ojet. By the end of the game i liked him just as much as the others! The music is another thing because OMG!! I didn't realize it at first, but the music for each zone is the SAME SONG?!?!?!?!! But it uses different instruments and genres as you move through different areas!! This was a big hit with me as I'm Autistic and music has always been an importance to me, something that always catches me. It was so soothing the way it worked. It was also amazing for highlighting specific area changes. The one that caught me off guard was [spoiler]when you went into John's house to find him dead. The music muffled, it felt sad somehow... It brought tears to my eyes-[/spoiler] IT WAS SO GOOD!! Great job using music that way! I also loved the little vague undercurrent story about the homunculi's creator. Made me want mooooore!

While I loved Basically everything, I had trouble with the trumpet music minigame. I had to retry it about 20 times. Clicking slightly off beat gets you a penalty, and for someone not great at those kinds of games, it got me failed out over and over again. I think there should be some forgiveness there. However, I did notice that after awhile, the grey circle thing heals itself. I did like that!

Poco is an amazing game! I can't believe it was free! The environments were hang-up-in-your-home PAINTING worthy, the music was top notch, and the characters were lovable (Gulch and Poco were my faves!). Totally recommending!

Typical point and click stuff in many regards, but the art style/graphics are wonderful, there are no galaxy brain solutions required (you and your noggin will probably do just fine!), and with one notable exception the gameplay is straight forward and immensely enjoyable.  The only fly in the ointment is the music mini-game where you must (ala guitar hero etc etc) type/click your action button at the same time as musical notes (well, the equivalent thereof) are falling down the screen in rather speedy fashion.

After having played it and beating it, I have to say, it did not disappoint.

As the store page states, Poco is an exploration and point & click type of game. Poco is the titular character: a 2-inch tall clown that was banished from the mysterious ""Circus"" and forced to live among the denizens of the Below World. In this other world, you will encounter the characters you'll interact with, the so-called homunculi, which represent the five senses of the human body--something I didn't know about until reading the store page in its entirety!

As for gameplay, as stated before, it's primarily an exploration and point & click type of game. You move Poco around by clicking on areas within the screen and can interact with objects and characters with your cursor. Using this point & click system, you can explore nooks and crannies of the Below World and find secrets hidden within. As for the mainstay of the game, you're tasked with solving basic puzzles and running errands for the homunculi in order to progress through the game. It's a simple game that requires very little thinking, respectfully to the developers, but it's relaxing and easygoing and won't make you stressful in trying to figure out how to get to the next part of the game.

The environments and artwork you encounter in the Below World are also gorgeous to look at. It's a mix between 2D and 3D and the animations are adorably done to the delight of the player. The game also boasts its own soundtrack, which was a joy to listen to. You can also purchase it as a DLC for $0.99 as for the writing of this review.

The one thing that shocked me about this entire game was that it's free. While the game can be completed within 2 hours or even less, depending on whether or not you're actively looking for secrets and how fast you're playing the game, the amount of effort put into this all of this made me think that there should be a price tag added to this. There is, however, a donation page from the game's main menu, and I am considering donating some amount to the developers as I believe they've certainly earned it.

As for anything else I can go on about, there is, from what I've seen, a ""hidden"" story behind all the happenings of how this world came to be. It can mainly be found through secrets acquired in the game, but since the game is only about 2 hours long, I really wouldn't look into and over-analyze anything. Even so, I immensely enjoyed every moment of exploring this game.

If there are any negative things I have to say, it's just going to be whether or not you enjoy these ""old school"" type of point & click games. It's absolutely not as arduous and cryptic as those old games from the 1990's and early 2000's, but it certainly has that feel to it. However, again, I immensely enjoyed every moment of this experience and I hope you do too, even if click & point games aren't really your thing. Give it a try!

I really do hope there is a sequel or at least continuation to this game's world, and if there is, I also hope the developers actually put a price tag to it because they've certainly earned the compensation. With all that being said, I'm grateful that this was free to download and play, and I hope to see more from Whalefall in the future.

A good job well done!",76561197986962211,0,17,102,0,102,2025-06-20T04:43:23+00:00

For whom those jingling bells toll.

In this game, we tour a downtrodden neighbourhood of sensory-driven homunculus and their relationship with a carnivalesque upper class so elite that they've forgotten what bread and circus means. In the process, we find family and community, develop talents at a comfortable pace without judgment, and engage in the sensory and creative.

The game channels Dropsy, Undertale and Earthbound, Smiling Friends, Hylics, The Outer Wilds, Rayman, Final Fantasy VII (and a minor amount of Souls/Metroidvania shortcut interconnectivity) and is rife with OneyPlays references, an extended Beatles gag, some wonderful Lo-Fi audiovisual aesthetic sensibilities, and genuinely fun minigames. It manages to synthesize all of these elements into a new personal favourite, a game I can see myself revisiting for its succinct cuteness and poignant delivery.

It's free and won't take longer than 2 hours. Go and play it.

PS. I wish there had been some reference to the Fool's journey around the major arcana, but I can't complain - this was a student project: well done! (I hope they got a grade they're happy with).",76561198060129085,972,1,160,19,141,2026-01-29T18:50:56+00:00

It's beautiful, a little disturbing, but tells an incredible story in 1-2 hours.

It's funny, happy, sad all it one. You face fear, joy, regret, growth, grief, friendship and more in this story. It's sweet and kind, but doesn't pull it's punches. Who knew a silly little clown game could get you to face the reality of death and the passage of time and how your achievements don't define you all at once???

My one, singular ""complaint"" is that some of the pick ups are not super clearly telegraphed, but whenever I got stuck I just used the hint button, it showed me where I needed to look but not what I was looking for, I clicked around a little bit, and badda bing badda boom I was on my way again.
I didn't have any issues with the mini-games, and the puzzles were super easy to figure out.
Honestly my only complain is that it wasn't longer lol, but also it certainly didn't need to be. It's incredible and perfect just the way it is.

Once again this game was beautiful to look at, the story was heart-wrenching, and all for the low, low price of FREE makes it criminal levels of theft.

The art is gorgeous. The music makes me so happy. I love Poco's little found family; they're all varying degrees of weird and flawed. It's a classic point and click adventure game with a very reasonable scope (a couple of hours). I love that they made Poco speak in a replacement cypher. I am a big fan of linguistics, so I gradually decrypted it as the game went on - it felt like I was getting to know Poco just as he was getting to know his new world (it's also super cute how he talks in child-like fragments).

The game also has such a cute sense of humour. Sometimes games like this can struggle to find a balance between being too serious and being so self-deprecating that immersion is lost. I think that Poco found its perfect groove, and there was an appropriate amount of levity given you're hanging out with bugs, but I still genuinely cared for these characters.

The story also really hit close to home for me. When the game hit me with the final choice, it was immediately crystal clear to me what I was meant to do in a way that made me realize just how much I liked this little world and its characters. After finishing it for the first time, I beat the game another good 10 times that week, managing to get a pretty solid speedrun of about 16 minutes. 

On top of all that, it's free?! I cannot recommend this game enough if you are at all interested in it. It makes my inner child so happy. I'm so excited to see what else the devs make in the future.",76561198325855444,0,67,661,0,630,2025-12-22T19:32:08+00:00

Well, let me praise the hard work of the indie team because not only did they release this game for free, but the characters, artistic scenes, and quirky dialogues (especially when the protagonist, Poco, speaks in a honking language) are all wonderfully done.

The downside? There are two minigames that took a lot of time to complete—fishing and the hit-the-trombone-notes game. But I succeeded, not only through extra precision and patience, but also by tweaking my gaming mouse’s DPI and lowering the game’s resolution to the lowest possible setting (it works, trust me).

Overall, it’s a really good game where everyone can learn something from Poco’s exiled journey: if they don’t want you, you can always travel to make new friends.

Yeah, Poco blew away my expectations. This is beautiful. Poco's art style is great, even if I found it strange at first, it's a good kind of strange. You can find peculiar characters and dumb jokes everywhere. The game's world is interesting, and the story is very cute. The fact that it is a point-and-click game didn't hinder the gameplay at all.

But that's not true. I'd probably love all point-and-clicks. I love other adventure games and puzzle platformers, and a lot of my absolute favorite games are essentially point-and-clicks without the pointing. It's BS game design I can't get through.
This game is simple and short, and that's why it has in a few minutes become one of my favorites. The puzzles feel natural, each screen piques curiosity and each little thing you find, be it an item or an unsolved puzzle, is either obvious in what it requires, or it sparks that curiosity that begs you to explore more.
This is how puzzle adventures should be done. This game knows how to lead and knows how to pace itself out, make itself varied enough not to bore.

None of that would really matter if it was a flawed, hard to understand game. It wouldn't be super enjoyable, but the good game design is second to how charming this game is.
All throughout it stays a heart-warming, sincere, and adorable story. In its core is a simple and effective tale for all ages that anyone with half a heart will find meaningful.
But what makes it truly shine is that it doesn't shy away from negativity. Sometimes it is in the few story beats that are simply sad, or how each character is dealing with some flaw, or the odd gruesome joke. 
The thing that is a constant is the same thing that makes it so gorgeous and wonderous: the bizarre, often dark world made up of unsettling creatures and rotting garbage. In a few glimpses we even get see the extents of unimaginable powers that reside in the world. As wholesome as most of the characters are, it is always apparent that this world can be just as cruel as it is goofy or heart-warming.
But the game doesn't dwell on it. The darkness is a background noise that doesn't encroach on the story that celebrates friendship and kindness. It's in the rejection of the cruelty that the game wants to find meaning.

Adorable, well-built, and fantastically compelling game. Fully worth the 2h of gameplay, especially because it is FREE!! You have literally nothing to lose, you only gain from playing it.

That being said I do feel as in the game is 90% complete. [spoiler] I wish there would be a greater revelation and explanation of the 'secrets'. I also feel the ending was a bit rushed: the ending is short, and doesn't really give the feeling of resolution. I also wish it was possible to beat the Evil Clowns, either as a secret achievement at the beginning or as a way to end the game. [/spoiler] For these reasons, I feel like the game was cut so incredibly close to perfection.

I almost quit and uninstalled when I opened the game to the circus tent menu and I honestly don't know why I didn't actually do that when I saw the terrifying Clown Judges in the first scene of the game. No clue what stopped me. Maybe it was that the opening stage minigames were genuinely difficult and the challenge proved distracting enough or maybe the fear just shorted my brains ability to process the option to nope out.

But ya know what? I'm so glad I didn't. When our main lil jester fell from the Big Top and I crashed into the colorful whacky world below I was immediately charmed by the art and colors so lovingly rendered for each location. It certainly helped that I was ecstatic that my journey would largely not involve the actual circus. As I fell into the rhythm of the soundtrack and became engrossed with the games puzzles and story I slowly found myself becoming comforted by the bell of my silly little hat instead of afraid of it and was able to spend more time directly looking at my silly little jester character.

bro FUCK giving a coherent review, I'm so mad I didn't play this last year and I'm even madder I heard absolutely nothing about this game.

This short, FREE (YES. FREE GAME! FREEEE GAMEEEE) point and click adventure has already breached into the list of favorite adventure games simply due to the sheer amount of charm and the absolutely PERFECT presentation.

Each puzzle is such a perfect difficulty, some point and click adventure games struggle with that element, with some being so easy that the puzzle is a bit of a waste of time, and others where the puzzle expects you to have a full degree in game design as well as a hand in developing the game to figure it out.

Right off the bat, the game hooked me with its first cutscene that let me know I was in for something special. The characters are all loveable, a favorite of mine being one of the npcs you help to reach the ending (you'll know) and hell even if you DON'T know, one of those npcs will probably be your favorite anyway.

This game is hilarious.

There were several moments were a visual gag or a blink and you'll miss it text quip almost made me let out a yelp once I processed it, one of the games achievements is tied to possible the funniest joke pay off I've seen in at least the past few months.

However, I would say the real draw of this game is just how stunningly beautiful and fun the backgrounds are. While the character designs and animations are a gold standard for quality, I found myself utterly enraptured by the painted backgrounds that you can see along Poco's journey.

Should I mention once again that this game is 100% FREE ON STEAM , NO CHARGE AT ALL FOR A PRODUCT THAT IS A GOLD STANDARD OF POINT AND CLICK PRESENTATION. It's also a short game, which might be a downside for others, only makes me more adamant that people should try it out.

It's also just visually and musically beautiful, as well, with a delightfully charming style that blends 3D models over hand-painted, painstakingly detailed backgrounds, all the while having very visually distinct characters. 

The story is not something I'd call ground-breaking but it's got a bit of a fairy tale/fable feel to it that really helps sell the whole thing, in my mind. It's very pleasant and sweet, and it did move my otherwise dead heart a little.
