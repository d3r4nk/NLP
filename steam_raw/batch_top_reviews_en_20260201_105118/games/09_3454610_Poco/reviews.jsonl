It was also amazing for highlighting specific area changes. The one that caught me off guard was [spoiler]when you went into John's house to find him dead. The music muffled, it felt sad somehow...

After having played it and beating it, I have to say, it did not disappoint.\n\nAs the store page states, Poco is an exploration and point & click type of game. Poco is the titular character: a 2-inch tall clown that was banished from the mysterious \"Circus\" and forced to live among the denizens of the Below World. In this other world, you will encounter the characters you'll interact with, the so-called homunculi, which represent the five senses of the human body--something I didn't know about until reading the store page in its entirety!\n\nAs for gameplay, as stated before, it's primarily an exploration and point & click type of game. You move Poco around by clicking on areas within the screen and can interact with objects and characters with your cursor. Using this point & click system, you can explore nooks and crannies of the Below World and find secrets hidden within. As for the mainstay of the game, you're tasked with solving basic puzzles and running errands for the homunculi in order to progress through the game. It's a simple game that requires very little thinking, respectfully to the developers, but it's relaxing and easygoing and won't make you stressful in trying to figure out how to get to the next part of the game.\n\nThe environments and artwork you encounter in the Below World are also gorgeous to look at. It's a mix between 2D and 3D and the animations are adorably done to the delight of the player. The game also boasts its own soundtrack, which was a joy to listen to. You can also purchase it as a DLC for $0.99 as for the writing of this review.\n\nThe one thing that shocked me about this entire game was that it's free. While the game can be completed within 2 hours or even less, depending on whether or not you're actively looking for secrets and how fast you're playing the game, the amount of effort put into this all of this made me think that there should be a price tag added to this. There is, however, a donation page from the game's main menu, and I am considering donating some amount to the developers as I believe they've certainly earned it.\n\nAs for anything else I can go on about, there is, from what I've seen, a \"hidden\" story behind all the happenings of how this world came to be. It can mainly be found through secrets acquired in the game, but since the game is only about 2 hours long, I really wouldn't look into and over-analyze anything. Even so, I immensely enjoyed every moment of exploring this game.\n\nIf there are any negative things I have to say, it's just going to be whether or not you enjoy these \"old school\" type of point & click games. It's absolutely not as arduous and cryptic as those old games from the 1990's and early 2000's, but it certainly has that feel to it. However, again, I immensely enjoyed every moment of this experience and I hope you do too, even if click & point games aren't really your thing. Give it a try!\n\nI really do hope there is a sequel or at least continuation to this game's world, and if there is, I also hope the developers actually put a price tag to it because they've certainly earned the compensation. With all that being said, I'm grateful that this was free to download and play, and I hope to see more from Whalefall in the future.\n\nA good job well done!", "author_steamid": "76561197986962211", "author_num_games_owned": 0, "author_num_reviews": 17, "author_playtime_forever": 102, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 102, "author_last_played": "2025-06-20T04:43:23+00:00"}

It's a classic point and click adventure game with a very reasonable scope (a couple of hours). I love that they made Poco speak in a replacement cypher. I am a big fan of linguistics, so I gradually decrypted it as the game went on - it felt like I was getting to know Poco just as he was getting to know his new world (it's also super cute how he talks in child-like fragments).\n\nThe game also has such a cute sense of humour. Sometimes games like this can struggle to find a balance between being too serious and being so self-deprecating that immersion is lost. I think that Poco found its perfect groove, and there was an appropriate amount of levity given you're hanging out with bugs, but I still genuinely cared for these characters.\n\nThe story also really hit close to home for me. When the game hit me with the final choice, it was immediately crystal clear to me what I was meant to do in a way that made me realize just how much I liked this little world and its characters. After finishing it for the first time, I beat the game another good 10 times that week, managing to get a pretty solid speedrun of about 16 minutes. \n\nOn top of all that, it's free?!

Poco's art style is great, even if I found it strange at first, it's a good kind of strange. You can find peculiar characters and dumb jokes everywhere. The game's world is interesting, and the story is very cute. The fact that it is a point-and-click game didn't hinder the gameplay at all. It was also easy and fun to 100% it in around 2 hours.

It's not just that I don't like them, I just don't have the drive to \"solve\" esoteric \"puzzles\". The games lose my attention.\nBut that's not true. I'd probably love all point-and-clicks. I love other adventure games and puzzle platformers, and a lot of my absolute favorite games are essentially point-and-clicks without the pointing. It's BS game design I can't get through.\nThis game is simple and short, and that's why it has in a few minutes become one of my favorites. The puzzles feel natural, each screen piques curiosity and each little thing you find, be it an item or an unsolved puzzle, is either obvious in what it requires, or it sparks that curiosity that begs you to explore more.\nThis is how puzzle adventures should be done. This game knows how to lead and knows how to pace itself out, make itself varied enough not to bore.\n\nNone of that would really matter if it was a flawed, hard to understand game. It wouldn't be super enjoyable, but the good game design is second to how charming this game is.\nAll throughout it stays a heart-warming, sincere, and adorable story. In its core is a simple and effective tale for all ages that anyone with half a heart will find meaningful.\nBut what makes it truly shine is that it doesn't shy away from negativity. Sometimes it is in the few story beats that are simply sad, or how each character is dealing with some flaw, or the odd gruesome joke. \nThe thing that is a constant is the same thing that makes it so gorgeous and wonderous: the bizarre, often dark world made up of unsettling creatures and rotting garbage. In a few glimpses we even get see the extents of unimaginable powers that reside in the world. As wholesome as most of the characters are, it is always apparent that this world can be just as cruel as it is goofy or heart-warming.\nBut the game doesn't dwell on it. The darkness is a background noise that doesn't encroach on the story that celebrates friendship and kindness. It's in the rejection of the cruelty that the game wants to find meaning.\n\n[spoiler]RIP Wurm, though.[/spoiler]", "author_steamid": "76561198024283661", "author_num_games_owned": 505, "author_num_reviews": 77, "author_playtime_forever": 138, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 138, "author_playtime_at_review": 138, "author_last_played": "2026-01-31T20:51:15+00:00"}

I thought the bell in the title art was a cat bell and I'd be playing a game about a cat. I almost quit and uninstalled when I opened the game to the circus tent menu and I honestly don't know why I didn't actually do that when I saw the terrifying Clown Judges in the first scene of the game. No clue what stopped me. Maybe it was that the opening stage minigames were genuinely difficult and the challenge proved distracting enough or maybe the fear just shorted my brains ability to process the option to nope out.\n\nBut ya know what? I'm so glad I didn't. When our main lil jester fell from the Big Top and I crashed into the colorful whacky world below I was immediately charmed by the art and colors so lovingly rendered for each location. It certainly helped that I was ecstatic that my journey would largely not involve the actual circus. As I fell into the rhythm of the soundtrack and became engrossed with the games puzzles and story I slowly found myself becoming comforted by the bell of my silly little hat instead of afraid of it and was able to spend more time directly looking at my silly little jester character. \n\nAnd beyond the free99 mild exposure therapy? A colorful varied cast of different interesting wonderful characters and an absolutely heartwarming theme of found family, friendship, and the value of helping one another. If I had the option to play this game for the first time again I would. Truly a lovely hidden gem with a banger soundtrack that puts a lot of Triple A titles to shame. I adored Poco and my only sadness is that there isn't anymore to his wonderful world for me to explore beyond the contents of this game. Oh well.

FREE GAME! FREEEE GAMEEEE) point and click adventure has already breached into the list of favorite adventure games simply due to the sheer amount of charm and the absolutely PERFECT presentation.\r\n\r\nEach puzzle is such a perfect difficulty, some point and click adventure games struggle with that element, with some being so easy that the puzzle is a bit of a waste of time, and others where the puzzle expects you to have a full degree in game design as well as a hand in developing the game to figure it out.\r\n\r\nRight off the bat, the game hooked me with its first cutscene that let me know I was in for something special. The characters are all loveable, a favorite of mine being one of the npcs you help to reach the ending (you'll know) and hell even if you DON'T know, one of those npcs will probably be your favorite anyway.\r\n\r\nThis game is hilarious.\r\n\r\nThere were several moments were a visual gag or a blink and you'll miss it text quip almost made me let out a yelp once I processed it, one of the games achievements is tied to possible the funniest joke pay off I've seen in at least the past few months.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would say the real draw of this game is just how stunningly beautiful and fun the backgrounds are. While the character designs and animations are a gold standard for quality, I found myself utterly enraptured by the painted backgrounds that you can see along Poco's journey.\r\n\r\nShould I mention once again that this game is 100% FREE ON STEAM , NO CHARGE AT ALL FOR A PRODUCT THAT IS A GOLD STANDARD OF POINT AND CLICK PRESENTATION. It's also a short game, which might be a downside for others, only makes me more adamant that people should try it out.\r\n\r\nPoco For President 2028 #GetThatClownANuke", "author_steamid": "76561198404669381", "author_num_games_owned": 129, "author_num_reviews": 4, "author_playtime_forever": 104, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 104, "author_last_played": "2026-01-06T16:47:59+00:00"}
