I used to play Papa's Burgueria and Hot Doggeria back in the day and up until recently a friend of mine has recommended me to play Freezeria on Steam and boy...

THIS GAME HAS REALLY GOOD CUSTOMIZATION, WTF? I managed to recreate much of the Ryu Ga Gotoku (Yakuza) cast with the visuals and clothes in-game, they really anted up the Steam version of these games, holy cow. 

Anyway, the game is still as fun as they used to be, but even more polished with more than welcomed QoL changes. Papa's Freezeria especifically is slightly more complex and complete than the other games, and I'm really a fan of it!

One thing that this game kinda misses the goal, as all games in the Papa's franchise is that it gets very stale and boring after you've learned how the game fully works... You're just basically following recipes day and day out, playing some minigames, eventually customizing your character and restaurant... That's pretty much it. It doesn't provide a hype progression over the passed days and it's the biggest reason I eventually drop on day 20~ish every time.

The game's core loop is still super fun, and I recommend every one that hasn't played this game to try it out! Do not miss on this piece of history!",76561198106311468,342,39,848,0,793,2025-08-05T15:47:40+00:00

Oftentimes revisiting a nostalgic title makes you realize the game was better through your younger eyes, but this is an instance where your eyes aren't tricking you. This is an addicting game, as addicting as it was during school. If any Papa's game has given you $7 worth of fun throughout your life, and I know it has, then you need to check this version out. Just the fact that there's no ads, meaning no lag, (finally! I always hated when the game would pause every instance I tried to add toppings) is worth $100.

To be serious though, it is essentially flawless for what it's aiming to be, and makes every effort to make things as convenient for the player as possible. It is genuinely almost perfect. The one con I would say is that they made the lobby bigger but kept the number of holiday posters and furniture the same. So, you need to buy duplicates, hope that the minigames give holiday prizes, and try to find furniture from other holidays that match your desired color scheme well enough, or else your lobby is going to be sparsely decorated. But that is one thing and just cosmetic, while in functionality this game is flawless and I love it. It feels like they thought of everything.
It's full, smooth, comfortable, and continues to slowly increase difficulty, but never so sharply that you actually struggle. Only enough to make you feel as if you need to focus a little more.

As an avid Papa's Freezeria enjoyer myself I can attest that pretty much everything from the original flash game is kept (if not improved upon) in addition to featuring new content and features from later installments. That said comparatively to the original this version is more challenging! Aside from a couple of the achievements being a bit tricky to get, there are a numerous amount of new ingredients added (including holiday exclusives, which weren't in the original). As a result there's [b]way[/b] more the player has to keep track of when preparing each customer's order.

This isn't to say the game only adds more layers of difficulty, there's some much needed quality of life added in too! Minigames are in Freezeria now and tickets earned from performing well each day (or using the new food truck feature that acts as a sandbox/practice mode), and successfully completing minigames grant free decorations (albeit seemingly from a random pool of items)! You can also buy coupons to entice specific customers to visit the next day, ensuring that customer-related achievements aren't at all luck-based. Specials not only give bonuses upon completing orders requesting them, but can even make days a little easier as each special is prepared the same way every time, regardless of which customer orders it. The pause menu also has a screen where you can review each order completed, giving accurate feedback as to how to improve..which I can only see being a positive addition for players new and old! Really the pause menu as a whole has way more utility, which is nice!

Seriously, I really would advise picking this game up if you're at all interested in time-management and/or restaurant games with cozy vibes, and a very affordable price at that!",76561198171251965,227,20,1960,0,1276,2025-12-16T02:36:59+00:00

holidays are fun and i like that you get to dress up your guy and restaurant for all of them. i also love the seasonal ingredients, unlocking them all makes getting through the month more fun. also the stickers (Achievements) are a great addition. i currently have 66/90. im surprised at just how much there is in this game, it's very simple but pretty big.
 the minigames which they introduced in the later flash games are back too. my one complaint is about these, the rewards they give are repetitive and i dont really want to have 7 of the same item. i really dont like the one where you match the order to the customer but that might be because i have a bad memory and dont really pay attention to who orders what.
this could be a downside for some people, but not for me: the gameplay is extremely repetitive. you're doing really just the same thing the entire game minus the minigames, so if you play one day and dont like the basic gameplay or dont like repetitive gameplay you will not like this game. 
overall: they really could have just rereleased the game from 10 years ago again to cash in on nostalgia with no additions but they didnt and i respect that alot. they actually added a lot that makes it feel like a new, modern game. it makes me excited for when they remake future games (looking forward to the hotdog one especially bc that was my fave)",76561198423390854,0,5,933,0,921,2025-02-14T01:42:44+00:00

I played Papa's games since I was in 6th grade, sneaking them on CoolMathGames, funnily enough it started I started with Freezeria. For the longest time I thought I was done with them because I remembered how stressed they made me. But now that I'm an adult and heard via Poofesure that the games were being released on Steam as deluxe versions, I couldn't help but get this game to re-experience it. And frankly, I'm glad I did.

THE POSITIVES

The presentation is as timeless as ever. Papa's have a distinct artstyle, yet one that'd fit perfectly in childhood books like Dogman, Captain Underpants, or Diary of a Whimpy Kid. The characters, while stiff as always, still have enough movement to showcase emotion and make every character feel like their own. The food itself too is extremely appealing looking. Often if I'm playing this game on an empty stomach, I end up craving sundaes.

The gameplay. Papa's Freezeria is an extremely easy game especially after you get some upgrades and decorate your resturant. However like games like Pizza Tower or Devil May Cry, the appeal isn't the difficulty in beating the game, it's in mastering it. This game can get very demanding when it comes to certain achievements and some days when you're utterly overwhelmed and mess up an order. Going for a perfect day with all 4/100% is genuinely a challenge. However if you just want to relax and make some sundaes, the game appeals to that too. I don't care about getting perfects, but still want to do well so it's a nice relaxing game, but not one I fall asleep playing.

The music. While it is one note and can get grating if listened to for too long, the dynamic behavior of the music can be a helpful tool against getting tired of it. Every menu has a different medley and even things like getting Awesome ranks in the sundae making section can affect small notes and keeps the background music fresh. If I don't feel like dealing with my own playlist and YouTube's avalanche of ads, Freezeria's music is not the worst thing to listen to.

Saving. You can save and quit Freezeria whenever you want, even in the middle of the day. It's also extremely stable to alt tab out of and check other windows. Just make sure to pause as despite it muting when you tab out, it's still running unless paused.

THE NEGATIVES

The only thing I can really think of that's downright negative about the game is two things.

Some achievements can be dumb. Ones like Kahuna on the Move where you're supposed to have someone's order ready before they even arrive can be utterly demoralizing to try and get. Given you don't know who's visiting any given day except the first one who enters in which case you don't have enough time to prep their order.

The minigames being only accessible right after a day finishes is annoying in my opinion. After a day I rarely want to play the minigames. If you could access them in your post-day menu like the shop, outfitter, or decorating your restaurant, that'd be something. Maybe have it in the parade menu to give that a purpose especially since Foodini is already there.

TL;DR
Papa's Freezeria is well worth the $6. It provides variety for everyone who likes time management games. From a simply relax pick up and play, to a challenging run to try and master it. Despite my two criticisms they're more nitpicks than anything and the latter one could simply could be fixed in a quality of life change. But even then they're not that big.

I cannot wait for Jack Smith to release later this year and for other Papa's games to be remastered. My hope's on Wingeria and Palleteria.

An awesome updated remake of the 4th game in the Papa's [Food]ria series(and the 5th overall Papa Louie game) with features and characters introduced in later installments. Still plays just like the original Flash game though, at its core, with some quality-of-life improvements.

I think Freezeria was an excellent choice for the entry to get the Deluxe treatment first. The sundaes/ice cream/""freeze""s(as the title implies)/smoothies/frozen yogurt cups/whatever-they-are look delicious in this game and the beach aesthetic combined with the campaign's first in-game year starting you off in Summer give this a nostalgic vacation vibe that I really appreciate.

Don't let the repetition of the gameplay loop fool you; if this type of game is for you(of course), you're sure to get hooked if it catches your interest, with so many things to look forward to building up towards. And like I said for Pizzeria Deluxe, the 90 achievements Free-Play Mode are awesome additions and it's great to see your options for them expand as you unlock new things!

This game is fun, its a nice remake of the old classic game we used to play on like cool math or something. It has a couple new features. Like a sandbox food truck mode which just allows you to experiment with different milkshakes, and more that I just can't remember at the moment.

If you are familiar with the old flash version you already know what you are getting into. If not? I'd recommend tracking down one of the originals you can find on just any old rando website. If you like what you see there, then I'd recommend buying this game as it is basically just that... but better, and with a nicer UI.

The only thing I wish Flipline Studios had kept in this Deluxe edition is the ability for the player to be creative with screwing things up and causing mayhem...

I also would've enjoyed it if something happened when a player reaches Day 100, for example : little things like that could have been added in order to break up the predictability of the game. Holidays are a good way to spice things up, but it would've been cool if there was a toggle to disable them, so players could customize their character and restaurant however they want. (This is possible now, but not ideal, as it's recommended to follow the holiday theme to earn tips.)

It has hella customization, all the additional content from the most recent Papa's restaurant games, and even a freeplay mode. So there's a lot more incentive for a relatively classic time management browser game.

I must re-iterate though; these are good games for their price. At worst, there are details missing in a bunch of places. For a few examples: There's no funny descriptions in the shop items, there's no freshness mechanic, there's no third row for furniture, there's no floor mats in the lobby for lining up... And I kinda wished the mechanics were just a little more polished and consistent. But much more importantly, not even the playable chef's misery survived all that well!

The story would always drive your character all ""how do I get into these situations?!"" and ""Wow, I hate this job already!"" but they downplay this drama in the intro to day one, making them excited and always happy to see customers. I don't know why the original browser Pizzeria, the SERIES DEBUT as far as I know, is the only game in the whole franchise to do this right; where there was practically no escape from Roy's anxious face language. It doesn't need to be quite on that level but still -- The story is there for a reason.

I'm also wondering why in the helium Pizzeria Deluxe is using the title screen music from Pasteria and not from the game they're trying to remake.

Overall, this duology is a tad bit overrated in the sense that it looks and sounds peak, but far from it. Time management is a nice genre for when you don't know what to do. (Watch your screentime tho.) I'm fairly excited for Flipline to slowly but surely remaster the entire series on steam. I would love to see how the other games and their unique mechanics will work in this modern formula with added content. Plus that way I-- I mean... YOU can play them on your Steam Deck. Given the details, I'm not sure I like the direction of this deluxe series. If it's just six dollars per game, I'll be all for it. They are just nitpicks, but they radiate enough uncertainty to feel at least a little underwhelmed by the final product, even if Flipline appears to be an independent and empathetic studio.",76561198312295471,0,2,1779,31,840,2026-01-27T04:00:47+00:00

Now I can finally play it again on any PC/laptop via Steam without losing progress, and the price + updates are still great.

However, I really hope the devs can raise the FPS cap to 60–144 for smoother gameplay.
30 FPS feels blurry and can cause motion sickness on modern monitors.

Please consider a High-Resolution / High-FPS DLC for a better experience.

A great laid-back game meant to help you unwind. You might not even realize how much time had passed as you play despite its simplicity, it can be quite addicting.

For those who have played the flash version, the gameplay loop is pretty much the same, with some additions:

1. Table Orders/Phone calls; These are the same as normal orders, just re-skinned. The only difference is the cutscene shown in the how the customer orders. Thus, it should be self explanatory, phone call orders have you answer the phone while customers order over the phone. Table orders involve a dinner bell, and your character will go up to them.

2. Food Truck Mini-Game; This feature involves you making drinks of your own, then giving it out to customers for free. There are no restrictions or recipes to follow. You just make your own, and hope that people love it. However, this feature is only playable after shifts.

3. Special Orders; These are specific drinks whose recipes must be memorized. Customer may order a special drink, you select to be on the menu, from time to time. However, on their ticket it will not show the recipe. Therefore, you must bring up the recipe book to see how to make the special drink. These special drinks do offer benefits such as higher tips, more tickets for the mini-games, or more points. I'll be honest, some of them look really pretty. Do take advantage of them!

4. 2nd Worker?!?!?!; Ok its not an AI that going to handle and create drinks for you, lets get that straight. After a few days of working, you will be able to gain a ""driver"". This 2nd worker will only appear during phone orders and table orders, often taking the order and delivering the drink to them. A nice little feature, so your own character doesn't feel so lonely.

5. Greater Customization; Yup, more options for hair, body, etc.... Make your character flashy! Outshine other customers! (yes, the customers do have great designs!)

6. Mini-games; Spend your tickets earned during work days to gain rewards such as decoration and clothing.

7. Holidays; There are holidays as you play the game. Thus, expect to decorate your restaurant in theme with the holiday, and when dressing up your character as well, there are bonuses involved.

8. More Customers; More people you probably haven't seen before, and customers that are seen in other papa games. 

Other than that, its a good game. As someone who is an avid FPS, strategy, and open-world enjoyer, its good to pick up from time to time just for the fun of it. I often see myself spending a few hours without realizing it.

Developed by Flipline Studios, this new edition expands on the original with a wealth of features, including character customization, seasonal content, unlockable specials, and more. Set on the sunny shores of Calypso Island, the game invites players to run their own ice cream shop, managing every step of the sundae-making process with precision and flair.

The core gameplay revolves around managing four stations: taking orders, building sundaes, blending them to perfection, and adding final toppings. Each station demands focus and accuracy, but the flow is intuitive and satisfying. There’s a tactile joy in carefully layering syrups, timing the blend just right, and placing toppings with finesse. Your performance is scored based on speed and accuracy, encouraging players to master the rhythm and gradually improve with each shift. This loop—simple on the surface but packed with rewarding nuance—is what keeps the experience so engaging.

A major strength of this Deluxe edition is the progression system. As you serve customers, you unlock new toppings, mix-ins, and decorative options for your shop. The game also introduces specials—predefined sundaes that, when completed, reward extra tips and boosts. Seasonal changes throughout the year bring themed ingredients and festive visuals, helping break up the routine and keeping the environment feeling dynamic and fun. Dressing your character in holiday-appropriate attire and decorating the shop accordingly even improves customer patience and tips, adding a small but clever strategic element.

Customization is front and center here. Players can fully design their worker and delivery character, with a wide range of clothing, accessories, and hairstyles. It gives the game a personal touch that makes every shift feel uniquely yours. Between workdays, players can spend tips on new furniture, posters, or music tracks, and even play daily mini-games to win exclusive prizes. These mini-games, while brief, serve as enjoyable interludes that offer cosmetic rewards and add light variety to the daily grind.

Despite all the upgrades, the gameplay remains calm and low-pressure. The challenge lies more in efficiency and optimization than difficulty spikes. Once you get into the rhythm, it's easy to lose hours fine-tuning sundaes for demanding regulars. That said, this steady pace may feel repetitive over time, especially for those looking for deeper complexity. The game rarely increases in difficulty in a significant way, and after a certain point, it can start to feel like you’re just repeating the same day with new ingredients.

There are also a few technical hiccups reported by some players, such as minor lag on specific systems or occasional performance drops, though these seem to be the exception rather than the rule. The game otherwise runs smoothly and maintains a bright, colorful presentation that’s both nostalgic and polished. The audio—complete with cheerful jingles, satisfying mixing sounds, and bubbly customer reactions—complements the lighthearted atmosphere perfectly.

Papa’s Freezeria Deluxe is a warm, relaxing experience that thrives on charm and routine. It doesn’t try to reinvent the genre, but it expands on its foundation in meaningful ways that fans of the original will appreciate. For players seeking a laid-back, customizable, and endlessly replayable time-management sim, this is an easy recommendation. Whether you're returning for nostalgia or discovering it for the first time, it’s a sweet and satisfying treat—one shift at a time.

While this version has more content, there was something the ipad version had I wish this one kept. The ipad version had furniture wallpapers, and floors that weren't associated with holidays (mainly because holidays didn't exist in the ipad version). There are some items you can obtain in the minigames that aren't holiday themed, but none can be purchased in the store. Like where is the Jacksmith arcade machine? I've obtained all achievements and haven't come across it. Also there were clothing items that didn't make it to this version, like the bomber jacket, which I remember rocking back then. These problems are more nitpicky than anything, but for what I would consider a definitive edition of the game, it's a shame to see that somethings didn't make the cut.

[i] On my scale, a 3/5 game is good. It is satisfying, fun, and otherwise worth the purchase price, with some caveats. [/i]

Let me get this out of the way from the jump: If you have no idea what the Papa Louie franchise is or Flipline studios is, stop reading this review and go play Papa’s Pizzeria first. That game is significantly more fun and is a better hook into the franchise, and if you love that game and want more [i] THEN [/i] come back here and consider Freezeria.

I love the Papa Louie games because they are all mindless and repetitive (thus being quite “chill games”), while simultaneously providing a degree of tactile and satisfying artisanry that many games struggle to achieve. 

Like all the games in the Papa Louie franchise, your character in this game is pressed into service as a barely-paid serf to his lordship Louie, who tricks you into running his hole-in-the-wall restaurant serving a single food of choice while he fucks off to a 5-star cruise for the rest of his unnatural life.

You, being either a braindead moron incapable of stomaching the thought of disappointing the high capitalist Louie or the victim of a very serious case of existential blackmail (what could he [i] possibly [/i] have on you??), never consider the possibility of just… not showing up to work and leaving Louie to deal with his own store. 

In this particular game, you are on a tropical island where you are running a fro-yo/frappe/milkshake shoppe. The core gameplay is similar to the rest of the franchise: you take orders, you assemble the food, you process the food, and then you serve the food. In Freezeria, this means you take order, you put proportions of ingredients into the cup, set the frappe to mix, and then add toppings. 

The biggest flaw with Freezeria is that the core gameplay loop is slower compared to the other Louie games. The portioning of ingredients into the cup requires more clicks and slower animations than other installments and topping the frappe is finicky and annoying after a while. But the biggest flaw to Freezeria is that the frappes take way too long to churn, requiring you to essentially do one frappe at a time. Compare this to Pizzeria, where the cadence of orders ramps up significantly faster and allows you to do more at a time.

If you’re like me and you like busting out orders fast, then Pizzeria is the superior game. Actually Pizzeria is just better regardless. But Freezeria is more Papa Louie’s, and could potentially be a slower-paced ease-in to the franchise as a whole. 

Personally, I find all of these games good for like 5-10 hours of intense immersion where you learn the patterns and pacing before arriving at the inevitable conclusion that working in the service industry [i] sucks. [/i] The repetitive nature of the tasks eventually wears on the consciousness and makes you want to stop playing (no wonder so many service industry workers want to die). Fortunately us gamers can turn off this game and let it sit and marinate in the back of your mind until the itch comes back. 

Freezeria in particular gets monotonous quick because of its slowish pacing. Like I said at the start, this game is good because all of the Papa Louie games are good. But comparative to its peers in the franchise, Freezeria is just… not as strong. But for $6, you get a massive game you’ll be able to revisit for years that will provide between 40-60ish hours of content and achievements to hunt. I’d call that worth my money.",76561198140426176,0,38,416,0,416,2024-12-27T04:13:27+00:00

But with Flipline releasing its line of Papa's games on mobile devices and now finally having their first release on Steam, the new generation can be introduced to these incredibly fun and addicting if simple time management games, and those of us who grew up on them can enjoy them once again. The additional features added with the deluxe version of Freezeria on Steam are only a plus to what is already an incredibly nostalgic game that's great for passing the time when there's nothing better to do.

I forget how long it took me to 100% the old version but this new one roughly took me two weeks to do with the free time I had and much like back then, I'm glad it's a chill vibe with a fun food theme to serve to costumers.

I remember the last real time I checked Flipline Studios was a handful of years ago, they delved into the mobile market for games but fairly recently, I was glad to see they're still making version for computers to play, not forgetting their roots there. So of course I bought this game and went down memory lane to see familiar elements and differences.

For those who want a fun, relaxing time making food with time management skills, in my opinion, this is up your alley. If I do have a complaint it's how as time goes on, the costumers doesn't go higher, it only caps at 7. However, when I decided to do the remaining achievements, I understood why, dealing with for example, 10 costumers would make the process more of a drag to continue with.

All and all, as I said, I have a very fun time! Also I hope Flipline Studios will consider porting the other Papa's web games as well, like Cheeseria (one of my favorites) and make PC ports of the mobile exclusive games, since they look fun in their own right.",76561198407010651,0,1,3206,0,3206,2025-06-07T01:51:19+00:00

However, is it severely lacking in comparison to Papa's Pancakeria? Absolutely yes.

There are a few things that bother me about this game in particular. 

Lets start with the fact that the booster mode for mixing is only PER CUP... Why not have it be all of them? What do we lose in terms of gameplay by that? 
At the same time, this game only allows for 4 mixing cups at once. The feeling of urgency and stress flipping 6 pancakes and 3 buns, like in Pancakeria, simply wasn't there. I only ask, why?

As for the category toppings; all of them look so much alike it's become more of an eye-memory coordination game rather than a cooking one. Why do I have to triple check -which- strawberry I have to put in the damn cup? It's a mess of colours; pure visual clutter and it doesn't add to the stress factor, only the annoyance factor. Somehow it also makes it feel like there's less variation in this game. You figure out how. 

For my last example I'll put my biggest frustration down. If you mess up an order, you can't choose between the already-mixed cups; no, you have to finish it in whatever order you took them out of the mixers. What in the absolute fuck? I had a poor customer wait the duration of 3 customers simply because I took 3 cups out of the mixers at once. Why don't we have the option to CHOOSE which cup we want to top first????

Listen, maybe I'm biased because I was like level 23148195 in Papa's Pancakeria, but you must admit that this game truly does lack some of the things that made Pancakeria great. 
Maybe for the next release we consider these points? 

Or just bring pancakeria back...",76561198997230111,66,6,118,0,118,2026-01-15T13:24:33+00:00

Perfect day for a sundae, I should say! See, I was thinking a little bit about maybe spicing things up a bit. Y’know, shaking the tree a little, seeing if something good hits. Of course… perhaps shaking the tree isn’t always the best idea. It reminds me of the time, maybe three, four years ago, when myself and lil’ Mitch were fishing up north of the Maple Mountain. Ah, you should’ve seen it, it was gorgeous – the conditions were just right for a great haul. Yet, lil’ Mitch, bless his soul, decided to shake a big ol’ pine. Down came the hive, of course, and, well, the rest is history. Long story short, we wake up in Oniontown with a dozen or so jars of pickles and absolutely no idea how we got there. Now, I tell you, my young man, that was quite the conversation with Mitch’s old man. Quite the conversation, indeed.

Now, I know I usually go for a medium cup. You see, it’s a long walk from here to where I’m staying and, well, my bladder’s not what it used to be. So, if I go for a big cup I’ll have to stop by the park and use their facilities. It’s no pain, really, it just feels a bit of an unnecessary stop. Yes, I think I’ll avoid that if I can. But, even so, I think a small cup wouldn’t hit the spot quite right. Now, Mitch tells me that a small cup can be just the right amount of frozen goodness. I’d love to believe him, but, well, he and I are quite different specimens indeed! Why, I’ve seen the deluded tomfoolery that boy puts in his body; perhaps I should be thankful that he only takes it in half measures, ha! No no, a small cup won’t do. What do you think, my boy? Ah, a man after my own heart – yes, I think I will: a medium, please.

Blueberries are my usual poison, it’s true, but as much as I’d like to pass on them for something “new and exciting,” the doc tells me they’re good for the ol’ pacemaker, so… yes: I’ll stick with blueberries today. I say, do you know what blueberries remind me of? Well, I suppose you’re probably too young to remember, but there used to be this absolutely marvelous candied bar called a ‘Blues Bar’. Oh, I wish they still made them. They don’t make sweet treats quite like they used to, that’s for sure. Ah, don’t look so disheartened, my boy – this place is certainly an exception! Oh, you couldn’t keep me away from here if you glued my cranium to a stick of radium! Like a fish to water, I am. Oh, yes. Crumbs, where was I? Ah. I know I’ve asked a thousand times by now, but please indulge an old man: has your stock of sardines come back in yet? No? A shame, truly. Oh well. In that case, make that a strawberry syrup. Good for the soul! Get that blended to perfection, young man!

My tackle box and I will be sailing out this evening. The Calypso Marlin will be mine sooner or later, you have my word. That nemesis of mine may have stolen years of my life from me, but I have a much greater punishment in mind when the job is finally complete. We’re at the tail end of the season, though, so I must remain sharp. There’s some long hours ahead. Get me some of that good meringue cream on there, since I’ve gone for the blueberries. They go hand in hand, really, it’d be a shame to split them apart. Oh, and let’s get a little bit of strawberry sauce, maybe some plum? Y’know, when I was just a little spud amongst the shrubs, we had a bit of a plum tree in the garden. Yeah! The plums themselves were… well, let’s just say there was a sharpness to them… a, well- Honestly, it wasn’t until my thirties that I truly experienced plums for what they could be. I’ve never looked back! So yes, lots of plum sauce, please! Nice and sweet and tart. Impeccable!

Oh, crumbs, I’ve only gone and done it again. You and I know it: this is the same as it always is. My ex-wife always used to tell me, “Walt,” – this was back when my compadres referred to me as Walt – “you have one trick and one trick only. You talk a good game, but you’ve got one trick.” Y’know, she’s right! I know what I like, and I like what I like. It’s why I like it! So, if you would please, some peanuts and a cherry on top would go a long way. Thank you so much, my good man. It’s so good to have such a polite, young gentleman running this lovely little shop. Oh, and please do say a warm hello from me to Jake in the back. He’s quite the little champion you’ve got there. Reminds me of my lil’ Mitch, though Mitch has never come to my aid in a frozen-treat-related emergency before! Quite the refined chap, indeed. Oh, my deepest condolences once more, my dear boy. I’ve taken up enough of your time, let me take no more. My ex-wife would be quite disappointed in the way I’ve conducted myself. “Walt,” she’d have said, “let the poor man do his job!” And that I will! Have a good day on me, young man.

100% – Fully upgraded shop, unlocked all ingredients and customers.  

[hr][/hr]  

[h2] Introduction [/h2]  
Papa’s Freezeria Deluxe is, without a doubt, one of the worst games I’ve spent money on. What should have been a fun, upgraded version of the classic Flash game ends up being a painfully outdated, tedious, and completely frustrating experience. The nostalgia wears off quickly, and what you’re left with is a repetitive grind and uninspired mechanics that just don't feel worth it.

Instead of being a fun throwback, this game is a massive disappointment. The addition of some new features and slightly better graphics can't save it from being an exhausting, unoriginal mess.  

[hr][/hr]  

[h2] Graphics and Visuals [/h2]  
[✔️] 🎨 The game is visually colorful, which is about the only positive thing I can say.  
[❌] 🖼️ The graphics are outdated and feel like they belong in a mobile game from 2010. There’s nothing fresh here to justify calling it “Deluxe.”  
[❌] ⚙️ The UI is clunky and unintuitive, making even basic tasks feel annoying and awkward. It's just a mess that does nothing to enhance the experience.  

[hr][/hr]  

[h2] Gameplay and Mechanics [/h2]  
[✔️] 🍦 The core gameplay of assembling sundaes and serving customers is the same as the original, but it’s where the fun ends.  
[❌] 🔁 The game is a boring grind. There’s no real challenge or excitement—just making the same sundaes over and over again with little to no variation.  
[❌] ⚠️ The mechanics feel clunky, especially when handling the ingredients and serving customers. It's frustrating to try and get things done quickly, only to have the game fight you every step of the way.  
[❌] 💸 The addition of ""deluxe"" features only feels like a cash grab, with most new content being just filler. There's no creativity here, and it all feels like padding to justify the price.  

[hr][/hr]  

[h2] Sound Design & Atmosphere [/h2]  
[❌] 🎶 The soundtrack is bland and repetitive. After a few minutes, it becomes grating and annoying. There’s nothing pleasant or memorable about the music.  
[❌] 🗣️ The voice acting is nonexistent, and the character interactions are flat and forgettable. There's no personality here at all.  

[hr][/hr]  

[h2] Pros and Highlights [/h2]  
[❌] Unfortunately, I can’t find any real positives here. The only ""highlight"" is the visual style, which is still a far cry from modern standards.

[hr][/hr]  

[h2] Cons and Drawbacks [/h2]  
[❌] 🔁 The gameplay is an absolute grind with no real challenge. It’s repetitive, boring, and incredibly tedious.  
[❌] 🖼️ The visuals are outdated, and the user interface is frustratingly awkward to use.  
[❌] 🗣️ The lack of meaningful updates or improvements from the original game makes this Deluxe edition feel like a slap in the face to fans.  
[❌] 💸 The game is overpriced for what it offers. You can find better experiences for free or at a much lower cost elsewhere.

[hr][/hr]  

[h2] Why 1/10? [/h2]  
Papa’s Freezeria Deluxe is an insult to its players. What could have been a fun, nostalgic experience turned into an annoying, tedious grind. The lack of creativity, outdated mechanics, and poorly executed features make it the worst purchase I’ve made in a long time. I’d recommend staying as far away from this one as possible—save your money for something actually worth your time.

The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible.
Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
Ooh, black and yellow!
Let's shake it up a little.
Barry! Breakfast is ready!
Coming!
Hang on a second.
Hello?
Barry?
Adam?
Can you believe this is happening?
I can't.
I'll pick you up.
Looking sharp.
Use the stairs, Your father paid good money for those.
Sorry. I'm excited.
Here's the graduate.
We're very proud of you, son.
A perfect report card, all B's.
Very proud.
Ma! I got a thing going here.
You got lint on your fuzz.
Ow! That's me!
Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
Bye!
Barry, I told you, stop flying in the house!
Hey, Adam.
Hey, Barry.
Is that fuzz gel?
A little. Special day, graduation.
Never thought I'd make it.
Three days grade school, three days high school.
Those were awkward.
Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive.
You did come back different.
Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
Hear about Frankie?
Yeah.
You going to the funeral?
No, I'm not going.
Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.
Don't waste it on a squirrel.
Such a hothead.
I guess he could have just gotten out of the way.
I love this incorporating an amusement park into our day.
That's why we don't need vacations.
Boy, quite a bit of pomp under the circumstances.
Well, Adam, today we are men.
We are!
Bee-men.
Amen!
Hallelujah!
Students, faculty, distinguished bees,
please welcome Dean Buzzwell.
Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of 9:15.
That concludes our ceremonies And begins your career at Honex Industries!
Will we pick our job today?
I heard it's just orientation.
Heads up! Here we go.
Keep your hands and antennas inside the tram at all times.
Wonder what it'll be like?
A little scary.
Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group.
This is it!
Wow.
Wow.
We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive.
Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!
That girl was hot.
She's my cousin!
She is?
Yes, we're all cousins.
Right. You're right.
At Honex, we constantly strive to improve every aspect of bee existence.
These bees are stress-testing a new helmet technology.
What do you think he makes?
Not enough.
Here we have our latest advancement, the Krelman.
What does that do?
Catches that little strand of honey that hangs after you pour it.
Saves us millions.
Can anyone work on the Krelman?
Of course. Most bee jobs are small ones.
But bees know that every small job, if it's done well, means a lot.
But choose carefully because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.
The same job the rest of your life? I didn't know that.
What's the difference?
You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.
So you'll just work us to death?
We'll sure try.
Wow! That blew my mind!
""What's the difference?""
How can you say that?
One job forever?
That's an insane choice to have to make.
I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?
Why would you question anything? We're bees.
We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?
Like what? Give me one example.
I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.
Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach.
Wait a second. Check it out.
Hey, those are Pollen Jocks!
Wow.
I've never seen them this close.
They know what it's like outside The Hive.
Yeah, but some don't come back.
Hey, Jocks!
Hi, Jocks!
You guys did great!
You're monsters!
You're sky freaks! I love it! I love it!
I wonder where they were.
I don't know.
Their day's not planned.
Outside The Hive, flying who knows where, doing who knows what.
You can't just decide to be a Pollen Jock. You have to be bred for that.
Right.
Look. That's more pollen than you and I will see in a lifetime.
It's just a status symbol.
Bees make too much of it.
Perhaps. Unless you're wearing it and the ladies see you wearing it.
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?
Distant. Distant.
Look at these two.
Couple of Hive Harrys.
Let's have fun with them.
It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.
Yeah. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom!
He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!
Oh, my!
I never thought I'd knock him out.
What were you doing during this?
Trying to alert the authorities.
I can autograph that.
A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?
Yeah. Gusty.
We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.
Six miles, huh?
Barry!
A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.
Maybe I am.
You are not!
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?
I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.
Hey, Honex!
Dad, you surprised me.
You decide what you're interested in?
Well, there's a lot of choices.
But you only get one.
Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?
Son, let me tell you about stirring.
You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.
You get yourself into a rhythm.
It's a beautiful thing.
You know, Dad, the more I think about it,
maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.
You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?
That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.
Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!
Barry, you are so funny sometimes.
I'm not trying to be funny.
You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
You're gonna be a stirrer?
No one's listening to me!
Wait till you see the sticks I have.
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
Let's open some honey and celebrate!
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!
I'm so proud.
We're starting work today!
Today's the day.
Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.
Yeah, right.
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...
Is it still available?
Hang on. Two left!
One of them's yours! Congratulations!
Step to the side.
What'd you get?
Picking crud out. Stellar!
Wow!
Couple of newbies?
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!
Make your choice.
You want to go first?
No, you go.
Oh, my. What's available?
Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.
Any chance of getting the Krelman?
Sure, you're on.
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.
Wax monkey's always open.
The Krelman opened up again.
What happened?
A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.
Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!
Oh, this is so hard!
Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler.
Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?
Barry!
All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...
What happened to you?
Where are you?
I'm going out.
Out? Out where?
Out there.
Oh, no!
I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?
Another call coming in.
If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.
Hey, guys.
Look at that.
Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?
Sign here, here. Just initial that.
Thank you.
OK.
You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.

Papa's Freezeria Deluxe is a fantastic and comprehensive update that successfully brings the beloved classic to a modern platform. This deluxe edition feels less like a simple port and more like a faithful reimagining, offering a beautifully polished experience with excellent HD visual upgrades, buttery smooth animations, and satisfying quality-of-life improvements. Making a complex sundae has never felt so fluid and engaging.

If you enjoyed the original Flash game, you'll immediately appreciate the subtle but powerful additions, like the ability to fully customize your chef and shop, and the improved system for tracking your daily perfect scores and achievements. These small touches add surprising depth and replay value to the familiar formula.

The core loop—taking orders, blending the perfect ice cream, precisely layering toppings, and nailing the drizzle—remains incredibly addictive and easy to pick up. The real joy is the flow state you hit during the rush hours. There is a deep satisfaction in perfectly layering a sundae, timing the blending mini-game exactly right, and earning a clean triple Perfect score from a difficult customer. It's simple to learn, but challenging to master, making every shift rewarding.

It’s an excellent, focused game for simply killing time and having some fun. The seasonal rotation of ingredients and customers keeps things fresh for a good chunk of the campaign.

My CAVEATS:
While I absolutely love the game, I must note that the main story campaign is on the shorter side compared to some of the later Papa's entries. Furthermore, the push to complete the final ranks, unlock all badges, or achieve golden customer awards can start to feel a little bit grindy. If you're looking for a sprawling management sim, this game might feel slightly slight. However, this focused design is also its strength.

Verdict:
This game is a charming, relaxing, and highly engaging time-killer that successfully preserves the spirit of the original while giving it a much-needed modern touch. I'd highly recommend this game, especially for casual players who want to scratch that nostalgic itch or for anyone looking for a fun, satisfying, and focused arcade-style cooking experience.",76561198037306122,123,56,1494,0,1494,2025-10-29T12:33:59+00:00

I was never able to get any of the games on mobile, but I was super excited to see that the Papa Louie games were being added to Steam! I love that the Deluxe version of Freezeria added in a lot of the features from the newer games like hoildays, minigames, and customizing your own worker, instead of just being the plain original.

The game is ridiculously fun, especially if you’re a little competitive with yourself or friends. Timing those orders perfectly feels oh-so-good, and watching customers freak out when you nail (or hilariously fail) their sundae? Pure comedy gold. It’s simple, addictive, and somehow makes you feel like a tiny ice cream wizard running your own frozen empire.

Sure, it’s a casual game, so don’t expect AAA-level graphics or mind-blowing mechanics — but honestly, who cares? The charm, the nostalgia, and the sheer joy of watching your freezer creations come to life are more than enough. This game will make you grin, laugh, and maybe even cry a little from nostalgia.

In short: Papa’s Freezeria Deluxe is a deliciously chaotic childhood banger that’s still ridiculously fun to play today.
