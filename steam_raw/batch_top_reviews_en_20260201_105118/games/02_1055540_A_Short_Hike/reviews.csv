It is such a cozy little game. It’s short, simple, and surprisingly relaxing.

In-depth review:

Pros:
- It was touted as a ""cozy open world"", and in many ways, I prefer it to a more expansive one. There's a surprising amount of activities stacked into a small space: from fishing, digging, watering flowers, boating, climbing, to treasure hunting (of which I found a grand total of zero treasures). There's no wasted space and that's great.

- Mark Sparling's music is fantastic. It swells in and really touches with a sense of exploration and wonder; and at other times knows to be quiet and allow the natural ambience to do the work. The second-to-last track just before you summit, with its sense of anticipation and adventure, was my favourite.

- Vertical freedom: from climbing Zelda-style (climb higher as you find more Golden Feathers), to the satisfying gliding once you reach the top, very few games have this sense of vertical exploration.

- Ending: without spoilers, I found the ending to be kind of sweet. As they say: A good journey deserves a solid landing, and this one lands quite nicely.

Cons:

- One save file. The inability to have two separate journeys seems like a limiting choice. It's a short game (my first playthrough was 87 minutes, including a few side quests), so it’s not a huge deal, but still I would’ve preferred multiple save files.

- My biggest gripe: the dialogue. Here are some quotes (slightly paraphrased from memory):
 “Just jammin’” “It’s like, uh, epic stuff man” ”Welp!” “Hashtag worst dad” “You’re so basic!”
 Did I suddenly go hiking surrounded by my millennial tech coworkers from Slack? Cause it seriously detracted from my experience. I know the developer didn't intend it, but I couldn't help but read a layer of irony and insincerity to a lot of the interaction. It would've been fine if a few characters talked like that, but the majority do. Also, the MC says “...uh” way too often. It felt like ""A Short Hike"" was trying to be relatable, but also self-aware and slightly ironic in that 2010s internet forum way. That’s not what I expected from a game about hiking and reconnecting with family and nature. As someone who values writing and dialogue very highly, this lost ""A Short Hike"" a solid 1 point in my books.

Conclusion: It’s a great short game which doesn’t overstay it's welcome. It gives a few solid hours of wholesome adventure, and then leaves on a good note. I actually would love more 5–10 hr well-crafted indies like this, in-between the 40–80 hour AAA marathons.

Overall score: 7.5 / 10",76561198118826347,0,24,262,0,262,2025-12-24T23:14:46+00:00

As I guided Claire up the winding paths, I felt less like a player and more like a pilgrim, my every step a meditation, my every pause an invocation of stillness. The mountaintop was not a destination, but a revelation: that beauty need not be vast to be overwhelming, nor complex to be eternal.

Right off the bat, the premise is simple, and it works. You're told to reach the top of Hawk Peak. No timers. No pressure. Just... hike. ""A Short Hike"", if you will.
But what that premise doesn't prepare you for is just how much the game ends up saying without ever really saying anything (if that makes sense).

Let’s start with the mechanics, because good god—the gliding. It's phenomenal. Freeing, fluid, meditative as hell. You’re gently riding the wind, barely flapping, just letting it carry you wherever, and I'm totally fine with that.
Climbing’s just as delightful, though in short bursts, which is a shame, because I adore climbing in games, and I would’ve happily spent half this game just scaling cliffs. But it’s all wrapped in the golden feather system, which is such a clever little design trick. Your stamina bar is now something tangible. Something you find. It’s organic and playful, never shoved in your face like, “Hey! This is the video game part!” It just fits, like everything else.

Then you’ve got all the little extras—fishing (which is super chill), a couple of races, some fetch quests, beachstickball (yes, it’s a thing), and just... a bunch of tiny things that somehow feel really alive. It never feels like the world exists for you. It feels like things are happening regardless, like you’re just stepping into a living, breathing place. People are out living their lives, the writing sells that perfectly. Nobody’s giving you lore dumps or rehearsed speeches, they just talk like folks who got caught mid-task. Short conversations, awkward pauses, sometimes even a little mundane in the best way. It makes the island feel like an actual place, y'know?

And visually? I mean, holy hell. The artstyle floored me. That chunky, pixelated 3D look—somewhere between a DS and a GameCube—is unlike anything I’ve seen. Not in a ""ooh, retro"" kind of way. It's stylized with purpose. Every tree, every rock, every craggy little trail looks like someone had a good time making it. It’s cozy, vibrant, weirdly nostalgic. If summer was a video game, this’d be it. It reminded me of life before everything went to shit—when people went outside just to exist for a while, that's the vibe I get from this place.

And the MUSIC! Don’t even get me started. Mark Sparling’s soundtrack is just magic. It’s calm, whimsical, deeply emotional at times, and always hits at exactly the right moment. There's that scene when you reach the summit, where you're presented with one thing... total silence. Just bloody wind. Then you catch the updraft, and the music slowly swells around you as you take flight. The sky shifts from deep-space purples to fiery oranges, then icy blues, and finally the bright, crisp blue of a summer morning as you reach the ground. It’s practically fucking poetic.

In addition to that, the open world itself is perfectly scaled, and if I could put it simply, small enough to feel intimate, large enough to make exploration feel rewarding. There’s no giant objective looming over you, just a gentle encouragement to look around, poke at things, talk to people, climb whatever catches your eye. The game rewards curiosity without ever punishing you for missing something. There’s always something off the beaten path, and the fact that there’s no map just makes you trust your instincts more.

The whole thing feels like more than just a cozy indie about birds and mountains. The hike up is the struggle. The glide down is the release. It’s about letting go, decompressing, learning to slow down and breathe a bit. And it never says that directly, which kinda works in its favor, as it inadvertently creates the space for you to figure it out yourself.

It gave me the same feeling I had when I first played Breath of the Wild, and that’s not something I say lightly. That quiet wonder. That urge to see what’s around the next corner, out of pure want, a fiery urge and passion to keep going. Bouncing from peak-to-peak, savoring those moments at the top.
Except here, there’s only one peak. One big, meaningful climb. And I took my time. I soaked in every minute... and absolutely loved it dammit!!

Needless to say, recommended!",76561198860524778,307,48,150,0,150,2025-04-05T22:40:04+00:00

A Short Hike is a game that captivated me in the first 5 minutes of playtime. Exploring the world feels intuitive and the developers have made every right decision in exploration. The introduction of mechanics is laid out in a way that doesn't force the player on a certain path, but guides them as time goes on. For example, I dove off the starting area in the complete opposite direction out of curiosity and despite that, nothing was wrong - I was even rewarded for it.

It's rare to see a game that does open-ended storytelling justice, you're allowed to do whatever you want and take your time with the things you find interesting. Moving through the world and learning about the environment, people, and even yourself feels like a breath of fresh air. There's no end of the world, no big bad evil to slay; it's just you and the island.

There were a lot of moments where the conversations you had felt like metaphors to real life. I especially enjoyed the first encounter with the fisher, who reassured you that sometimes you have to be patient, and that things will come when the time is right.

I warmly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys the simple moments in life, feels a bit lost, or simply doesn't know which game to play next in their library.",76561198231299864,209,5,379,0,90,2025-04-29T15:41:28+00:00

What follows is less about the destination and more about everything you discover along the way. Fishing, racing, treasure hunting, skipping stones, helping strangers, or just gliding through the air for the sheer joy of it — the island is packed with cozy distractions.

The controls are buttery smooth. Climbing feels natural, gliding is pure freedom, and every golden feather you collect expands what you can do. By the end of the hike you are chaining jumps, soaring across valleys, and pretending you are in an extreme sports movie sponsored by birds.

The island itself is delightful to explore. Every path leads somewhere interesting, and wandering off the trail is encouraged. You might find a hidden beach, a secret cave, or an NPC with a surprisingly witty line. The characters you meet are quirky, funny, and often heartwarming, and the small favors you do for them feel meaningful rather than like chores.

Visually, the game uses a charming low-poly style with just enough detail to make the world feel alive. The colors are warm and inviting, and paired with the relaxed soundtrack, the game becomes an instant stress reliever. It is the kind of place you wish you could visit on a real vacation, preferably without worrying about running out of golden feathers halfway up a cliff.

The story is short, but it is told with sincerity and humor. By the time you reach the top of the mountain, the emotional payoff lands perfectly. It is a reminder that sometimes slowing down and enjoying the little things is more rewarding than rushing to the finish line.

Final verdict: A Short Hike is equal parts wholesome adventure, relaxing exploration, and gliding simulator. It is funny, heartfelt, and surprisingly deep for such a compact experience. If you have ever wanted to turn off your brain, breathe in some pixelated mountain air, and race a rabbit while dressed as a bird, this is your game.",76561197982507630,6532,24,313,0,313,2025-08-11T08:51:34+00:00

The original development started as a small break from Untitled Paper RPG, a large scale project that Adam was developing as a sort of spiritual successor to the Paper Mario franchise, a 2D turn based combat RPG known for its beautiful color palette and turn based combat. Development started in 2018 for the game, inspired by shorter indie games and the success that they’ve gathered over the years, and would eventually release a sort of inside look (link below) on Twitter that same month on what he was working on. Eventually after years of hard work and dedication, the game would release to great fanfare and would even have a couple of mods dedicated to it like a Multiplayer Demo that would only be around for two weeks (RIP, wish it was peer to peer officially) and a sort of Google Translate mod which goofs up the dialogue and was inspired by similar Dark Souls mods. He’d also release the demo for Untitled Paper RPG later on with the caveat that he might never release it in full as well as some sort of Pumpkin Puzzle game for his fans for a limited time. While I’m very much interested in seeing what this Untitled Paper RPG would look like in the distant future (if it ever happens, such is the curse of indie game design), I wanna bring it back a bit and discuss how I even heard of this game and why I played it. I’m personally not usually a “cozy game” guy, but I have a lot of respect for the vibes and as such when I heard about this game through my home E’s DarkRaptor and Bad Ghosts (who has a video on it, check it below), I figured I’d give it a wishlist. Of course the dork Ghosts would send me the game too and I promised to play it at some point and as such, here we are so here’s my summary I guess.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxkCn-8CuwQ&ab_channel=BadGhosts (Ghosts video)

The plot for A Short Hike is a relatively simple one: you play as a young bird named Claire who is dropped off on a ferry headed for Hawk Peak Park to visit her Aunt May for the summer, who works as a ranger there. Claire seems kind of melancholic however, not her usual self and it’s because it turns out she’s waiting for a call about “the thing”. Her Aunt May however tells her that the only phone reception on the entire island is on the top of Hawk Peak and in order to get there you’ll need to go on a “short hike”, and from there you’re basically let loose to explore. The actual gameplay itself from here is also rather simple: you basically run around with the goal to collect Golden Feathers; which allow you the ability to climb, fly and jump around for a lot longer. You can get these through finding them in the environment as well as purchasing them (through finding chests full of money, digging up treasure and completing side quests). A lot of these side quests are more on the cozy side and involve racing around the island with certain limits (like using only a certain amount of feathers), playing “beachstickball” (volleyball but smacking them with sticks) and just talking with fellow islanders. You can navigate around the areas through pouring buckets of water on flower seeds to get a bouncy boost, using hot springs to fight off the cold (which slowly makes you lose your feathers until you sit by a fire/in a hot spring) or gliding and diving around the map. Honestly it’s a relatively simple loop but it has a decent amount of depth and is honestly just pretty relaxing; this game is a really cozy and chill time that you can legitimately destress to after an awful day and as such I don’t really have any complaints about it. It’s just fun, maybe not fun in the traditional sense for me in the sense of shooting gangsters on the street (in a video game), but a nice time where you can just zone out and decompress. Also to finish the story section (spoilers ahead), [spoiler]the plot finishes when Claire reaches the top of Hawk Peak and calls her Mom who reveals what the worries have been about: she’s had surgery which goes fine. Eventually they talk about how her mother and Aunt May used to hike up there all the time and honestly get into a heartwarming talk about being worried for each other and communication before Mom tells her to “catch the drift”. Doing so allows you to capture Hawk Peak’s majestic atmosphere on the way down and talking to Aunt May will have you recount your adventures before you go to sleep.[/spoiler]

To summarize my feelings on atmosphere and sound design, I’m just going to state here first that there’s no voice acting and honestly that’s fine because the game doesn’t really need it anyhow. In a lot of ways it’s very similar to Animal Crossing, where you hear repetitive sound pitched noises as their way of communicating and Animal Crossing is pretty cool so no complaints. The game itself is beautiful as hell, filled with vibrant colors directly inspired by “The Canadian Shield” in Autumn, an area for which I’ve never been to but can imagine being cold as hell. If this is what the game looks like, then perhaps one day it would be cool to go up there because honestly the game is beautiful. Also I’m a sucker for the Playstation One styled “chunky graphic” style, having a fondness for indie horror games developed by the likes of Torture Star so this is also all very appealing. The actual sound design itself is great too, and sounds immersive as you splash amongst the rivers near the beaches or the pattering of the climbs up the cold stone wall to the peak of the mountain.  Finally there’s the soundtrack: composed by Mark Sparling, it was inspired by soundtracks for older games like Firewatch and Animal Crossing: New Leaf (which he listened to every day while creating the compositions) among other artists like Studio Ghibli’s Joe Hasashi and kind of emulating that wholesome uplifting style lo-fi style that really hits the vibes well. I don’t know if I could really list a “favorite track” persay though I’d probably list “Snow, Lots of Snow” for it’s calmer and somber sounding piano/string combinations. Either way to be honest, everything pretty much fits as you’d expect for a super wholesome and positive feeling cozy game. Honestly that’s pretty much how I would summarize my feelings on the game as well: it's a positive feeling, super wholesome and just a nice time and honestly in the f u c k ed up world that we live in and all the s h i t t y feelings that inhabit it? It’s a nice break to take after dealing with all of that, and if I were to give a general runtime I would say it depends on how long you wanna stay. I spent around three and a half hours completing the game and exploring it but my dude Ghosts spent at least twelve hours just kind of exploring and vibing on his own so just take it at your own pace and enjoy it, especially considering it’s only eight dollars at most not on sale?

The game looks amazing and colorful, very fitting for the atmosphere and even the world has different terrains which makes it interesting. The sound design and the soundtrack is also nice, the controls for both controller and keyboard are mostly alright. The story doesn't seem anything special at first, however going more into the game we can learn more about the characters who are around and also about the main character and her development throughout the game. Gameplay wise is also straightforward, as you can complete quests for possible rewards, collect feathers which is basically the stamina for the character and reach to the top of the area. These doesn't really sound that interesting, but considering the game is only 5 - 6 hours to beat, it does it's job and pretty fun to go around in this world.

But if there is one thing I didn't really like is the boat controls, but luckily it's not necessary to use it.

Other than that A Short Hike is a great game and it's pretty good for relaxing and discovering new places.

As you can already guess from the title A Short Hike is a very short laidback exploration-focused platformer — we are talking about 1- to 2-hour play time — but I couldn’t help but keep smiling through the whole time. It is a great example that a game doesn’t have to be complex or big to be great. All it takes to make something great is a simple idea that’s well thought out and executed.  

The game gives you one simple task, go and climb on top of the Hawk Peak mountain so you can call your mum. However you quickly realize that this is not the whole point, but rather the memories you create from meeting the locals and interacting with them. You will compete in a local race, play Beachstickball which is pretty much the same as volleyball but you hit the ball with a stick, meet a local fisherman that teaches you how to fish, help an artist to paint his best work of art and many more. There is so much to do, I almost forgot about the main goal. I had so much fun talking to the locals even though the game doesn’t provide any dialog options, but every line is well written, making the dialogue fun, short and memorable.  

As you complete all those requests and challenges, you gain certain items that unlock new features for you or so-called ‘Golden feathers’ that help you fly higher, sprint and also climb for a longer period of time. It helps you to reach places that were once unreachable. This way it keeps the player engaged in the game till the end. The map is so well made that it doesn’t really matter where you go, because there is loot on every corner. You will either find some coins or items. Finally a game that really rewards me for going to weird places. 

Since this game is about platforming I can’t not talk about how it feels to play. It’s a very simple game with just a few mechanics that are intuitive and responsive. Even though the camera is fixed and moves only in certain areas, I never experienced any problems with character jumping somewhere I didn’t want to — unlike in most titles that have fixed camera angles. Also there isn’t really any challenging part or jump that would make me want to tear my hair out. It is just pure relaxing experience. 

What really enhances the cozy vibe is the smooth, beautiful pixel art, where at first I was kind of surprised that there are no outlines but then it clicked with me. This way it makes it much more pleasant to look at the image since it is extremely light for your eyes. And also the soundtrack just tops it off nicely.

A Short Hike perfectly served its purpose by allowing me to play something fun while also somehow giving me a break from all this gaming. It is perfect for those days where you want to take a breather from all that’s happening and relax. I really enjoyed my time with it and recommend it with all my heart. I am sure that everyone will enjoy it at some point in their life and I am already looking forward to when my time comes again so I can replay it.",76561198088804426,0,35,150,0,150,2025-07-07T14:06:04+00:00

I really liked the freedom this game offers in terms of climbing at your own pace but enticing you to explore a bunch of alternative paths. One way this is done wonderfully is having you collect 7 golden feathers before you’re able to make it up all the way to Hawk Peak. It’s nice spending some time roaming around the island, getting to know its visitors/inhabitants, and finding little secrets along the way. Something else I particularly enjoyed as a completionist is that I managed to complete most of the achievements without a guide.

The dialogue is actually really concise and silly without coming off as overly reddit, which I can always appreciate. There's a few uhhs and umms here and there but nothing obnoxious or unrealistic to waste your time.

It's not half bad as a simple platformer either. Getting more feathers and being able to climb higher and get better airtime and speed on glides feels really rewarding, especially at the start where every extra jump or second of climbing makes a big impact.

+ Love the graphics. Very cute, love the pixel art concept.
+ The collectathon aspect is fun.
+ You can continue collecting achievements even after you end the game.
+ Fun areas to explore (although somewhat difficult to navigate).
+ The NPCs are charming and our interactions with them are pretty interesting.

[h1] ❗Cons [/h1]
- The isometric nature of the game and how it auto-rotates in certain angles when you're gliding makes it confusing to navigate sometimes.
- No visual map, only a compass to guide where you are going. Navigation is tricky if you are forgetful like me.
- Some activities/achievements are impossible if you struggle with navigation in-game (e.g. racing) or using multiple keys to complete tasks (e.g. fishing). I had to give up on some achievements because it felt like too much work/stress.
- It wasn't clear what 'taking a nap' at our aunty's house meant so I panicked when I was suddenly shown the end credits. Thankfully we could still continue the game after, but still... a headsup would be nice lol.
 
All in all, I do recommend it because it's sweet, adorable game, but if you have similar struggles as me, don't stress too much on getting all the achievements.

The game is definitely worth the buy, for the small amount of time that I was in Hawk Peak, I have felt more joy and endearment than  I would in whatever slop I would be playing in my free time. The game hits all the right notes, from its wonderful soundtrack, which has been carefully placed in different parts of the mountain to evoke a feeling, to its lively inhabitants who are all going about their day, climbing the mountain. Every interaction and every pathway feels intentional, and even though the game is short, it never feels rushed. Every branching route feels like the ""right"" path, as in this story, the journey to the top isn't a linear course, but rather is a reflection of your curiosity. The game doesn’t demand anything from you. I took it at my own pace, and I think it made the journey a bit more worthwhile, as compared to me just rushing to the top.  I feel like, in that way, the way the game wants you to play lines up perfectly with the story it’s trying to tell.  Overall, A Short Hike is an endearing, cozy gem that I think everyone should experience at least once. It’s a gentle reminder to slow down, take a breath, and enjoy the small moments both in games and in life.

There's also the movement which was extremely satisfying to me. The climbing and gliding and the golden feathers made this a joy to play and experience, getting to a high point and then gliding down felt so smooth and enjoyable and along the way you might spot something new to check out and interact with. The style and aesthetic of the game also really adds to the charm, it can get genuinely so beautiful, especially when you reach the very top of the mountain.

Play as Claire at a camp with the basic intent to get to the top peak of the mountain.  You certainly aren't going to beeline straight there, as you'll need to acquire several Golden Feathers to jump multiple times in the air as well as give you stamina for wall climbing.
Along the way you can meet many other kids at the camp, and like Psychonauts they have various fun personalities and dialogue.  Be sure to talk to some of them several times, as they will react to you bugging them.  (""NO!"" ""NOOOOO!"" ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"" ""NO MORE!"" lol!)

While I reached the peak and flew back down to complete the game in 90 minutes, I didn't do much of the side events and I missed meeting several fun people. This is absolutely an ""enjoy the journey / it's not about the destination"" game so don't rush to the top.

Given that you can complete the main goal within 1.5-2 hours, it's still a great experience regardless.

The game's not hard, controls are easy to understand. I'd recommend it if you want your kid/partner who doesn't play video games to get used to video games, though kids probably might not understand some dialogues.

If I were to ding points, it's on the wonky camera when gliding between areas, and I'm not a fan of the default big chunky pixels (you can tone it down).

But the best is to getting to the peak of the island and taking it all in. It's awesome, exhilarating, and also quite moving all in moments of at most 1 minute. It's an experience to be had.

This is such a cute game! You play as a city bird who goes to this island for a bit, and need cell phone reception for a very important call, so your aunt tells you to go and climb a legit mountain. Since you have nothing else to do on this small island, it seems like a good idea, since that's where you’ll find reception. But, ofc it’s not going to be easy and you will definitely need help getting up there. 

### Gameplay

- I really enjoyed collecting golden feathers to allow myself to climb even higher. There were so many different ways to gain elevation & and ways to travel places. I really enjoyed all that there was to do in terms of getting from A to B.
- While this was a short game with a very simple objective, the island itself felt so dense with people, treasures, fishies, activities, it really had something on every corner of the island. I enjoyed meeting all the people (they were all so damn sassy tho LMAO which i LOVE), helping solve their problems, and it really truly made the island feel so alive. I genuinely cared about everyone and everything, and kept coming back to see if there was more dialogue, which there always was.
- The objective is to go up the tallest mountain, which as your aunt says is just a short hike, but for me, ADHD prone too, I’d go and see that there were these pockets of things to do, coins to collect and I’d find myself eventually watching someone paint, or having to help find someone’s watch. There was also just levels upon levels of stuff and little hilly plateaus, and your character can glide here and there which made it super fun. I liked bouncing on the flowers to gain elevation and then nyooooming down to where I needed to go.

### Graphics & Art Style

- It looked like the island was made and then they applied a pixelated filter, which was fuzzy looking but I liked it alot haha.
- The coloring of everything was very aesthetically pleasing and cozy-like. I loved how each area had their own theme color so you knew which section you were in. The last bit of it when you’re at the top is just so nice, it really feels like the whole point of getting there was worth it.

### Sound & Music

- The music was really great background music in that way. Like it just fit into the world. I can’t really remember how it goes but it was just perfect. Again, in each area there was a specific song for that area, and when you’re doing certain activities, the music would change as well. It felt cozy, calming, and at moments where it needed to feel intense it did as well.
- Sound effects were also done very well. I saw they used some chiptunes and other more generic noises, and I thought it was implemented well. The flowers had a great boinginess to it, climbing felt actually like climbing, flying like flying, those little things that you don’t really think about really contributed to the general feel of the game.

### Performance

- This was a really polished game! At no time did I feel any stuttering, encounter any bugs—I could tell that alot of thought, alot of quality control and alot of playtesting went into it. There was also a nice group of playtesters that the developer gave credit to. When the game’s scope isn’t that big I do feel like it’s easier to make sure you deliver a really great product.

### Overall Impressions

- *What did you like most?* I really enjoyed collecting everything the most. To me, it felt like it was a very mini version of animal crossing, and I love the whole wander around and find things vibe. I did wish there was a map, BUT i think it was intended for there not to be one so you can really wander around and find things out for yourself. I liked how you could get from point A to B anywhere in any way.
- *What didn’t work well?* Some of those mini games were frustrating!!!! And again, I really wished there was a map hahaha. But they were such a minor thing. Oh and I had to kinda get used to how the camera would move at certain angles, but pretty soon it felt very intuitive.
- *Would you recommend it?* 1000% yes, and its such a short game too. I am super slow at playing games so I’m usually double the time of HowLongToBeat LOL (and i leave it on when i get distracted with other stuff haha)

I played it for the prompt ""Play a game that reminds you of summer,"" and honestly, what feels more summery than hiking up a mountain in search of cell service? From the moment I arrived in Hawk Peak Provincial Park, I knew I was in for something special.

You play as Claire, a bird visiting her aunt’s cabin, who needs to make an important phone call. The problem is, there’s no reception... except at the top of Hawk Peak. That’s your main goal, but A Short Hike never forces you to rush to it. Instead, it gives you the freedom to wander, get sidetracked, and discover the park at your own pace.

And that’s where the magic of A Short Hike lies.

Hawk Peak Park is small, but it’s packed with personality. Every path you take seems to lead to something, either a new character, a hidden treasure chest, or a shortcut you didn’t notice before. The island is full of little details that reward curiosity. The verticality of the world is one of its best features; you’re constantly finding new ways to climb higher or glide farther, and each discovery feels earned.

The star of the gameplay is the golden feather system. Feathers act as both stamina for climbing and extra jumps for reaching new areas, and finding them becomes an addictive little scavenger hunt. Sometimes they’re hidden in plain sight, other times you’ll have to barter, explore, or help out another character to earn one. This makes progression feel natural and tied directly to exploration.

The people you meet along the way make the park feel alive. Every conversation is short but packed with personality, and the writing manages to be both funny and heartfelt without ever dragging on. Even the smallest interactions feel worth having.

Despite being only a few hours long, A Short Hike feels complete. There’s fishing, treasure hunting, races, and even a surprisingly fun beachstickball minigame. The world is small enough that you can learn its layout by memory, but varied enough that it stays novel until the end.

I ended up 100% completing it because I didn’t want to leave. That meant tracking down every golden feather, watering all the hidden sprouts, helping every character, and chasing every last bit of dialogue.

I understand why it’s short. Part of its charm is that it doesn’t overstay its welcome, but I still felt a pang of sadness when the credits rolled.

If you haven’t played A Short Hike yet, do yourself a favour.

Some games you finish and move on from. A Short Hike isn’t one of them. It lingers in your head like the memory of a perfect summer afternoon, when the air is warm, the sky is clear, and for a little while, the only thing that matters is the view from the top.",76561198052442141,1667,24,162,0,162,2025-08-08T21:02:25+00:00

The biggest complaint I have is that the Linux version has a bug that causes the game to occasionally lose input from the controller's sticks and them only (tested with both Steam Input on and off, occurred with both). This seemed especially common with my DualShock 4, at least in part because mine disconnects fairly easily (loose micro-USB port + I haven't MacGyvered a way to keep the connector still) - every time a disconnection happened, the game lost input from the sticks upon reconnecting the controller, but I'm certain it happened randomly as well. My Xbox 360 controller also triggered the bug. I didn't see the bug while finishing up with completing the game in Windows even though my DS4 lost connection multiple times. It was annoying to keep restarting the game over and over again to get the sticks to respond since moving with the D-pad was not fun, so this is a huge minus for the Linux version specifically. A workaround on Linux might be playing the Windows version via Proton but I didn't try that so I have no idea how well it works beyond what other players have reported on ProtonDB.",76561198290888768,356,73,260,0,260,2026-01-12T18:25:30+00:00

Praising this game is like beating a dead horse, but I will say this game is still a lot of fun. Granted, I also feel this game is a bit overpriced when at its full-price (though $8 is not asking for that much anyway). The game is very short, as the name suggests, probably clocking around 2 to 3 hours to get a majority of the quests done, on top of exploring the island to its fullest. Even getting all of the achievements really doesn't take very long either (though I needed a guide, especially for the fishing). 

Regardless, this is such a nice shortform game. From the plethora of movement options with running, flying, climbing, and even getting a boat(!!), the game has the spirit of Animal Crossing with the freeform exploration of Breath of the Wild. The movement is incredibly satisfying, especially when you pick up a ton of air and you learn how to dive to pick up speed. Oh yeah, that's real nice. The game's challenges are enjoyable, but borderline become jokes once you collect all of the feathers. But the progression is steady and probably after an hour you'll probably be at the very peak Claire was told about at the beginning of the game. The island has plenty of little secrets hidden within and without, with some extra little islands that may be a bit more hidden(!) There's fishing, treasure hunting, races, hidden paths, characters, collectibles, etc. Why yes, this game is quite cozy! The island is peppered with abundant foliage and biomes - all encompassed on this small, mountainous island. The characters are warm and welcoming, with some showing their own vulnerabilities and growth even in the short runtime. And the music is also quite nice, with some accordions, acoustic guitars, synths, chiptunes, pianos, and so on, with a dynamic sheen where instruments, sections, and even full on songs transitioning in and out depending on what part of the island you're on or how fast you may be moving. Once again, feels like a mashup of Animal Crossing and Breath of the Wild's compositions and designs. 

I'd rank this game higher if, again, it wasn't for the fact it was just, so short! I know that was its purpose, but this isn't a game i'll probably be coming back to, not anytime soon at least. However, I also finished this in three separate play sessions. Depending on the person you are, that's not exactly a bad thing - sometimes games don't need to be played for hundreds of hours to be good - honestly I feel most of bethesda's catalogue is proof having a game that is hundreds of hours long doesn't make it fun or enjoyable. 

Still, this game just doesn't have that much replay value compared to other 3D platformers or even other ""cozy"" games in the same vein. Considering how popular this game was, it certainly had a lasting impact and inspired its own throe of cozy 3D collect-a-thons too. The amount of things the game does is still very impressive in its own right, I just feel the game's enjoyment factor is capped by its length for me.",76561198203151278,0,22,334,0,334,2026-01-01T22:37:27+00:00

The main attraction of the game is the world of the game. Meeting NPCs is definitely a must, as they each have something to offer – whether that be advice, a funny line, or cooperation via item exchange. The loop of trading features and exploring is simple but incredibly satisfying. The platforming feels like it’s the least difficult part of the game but also very fluid.
The theme of the whole experience is chill, with cosy graphics and a calming soundtrack; it’s a full package of relaxing experiences that can be completed within a single event, but also stays with you long after.
In the end: A fantastic little adventure that has heart and humour! A must-have for anyone who enjoys adventure, platforming and heartwarming stories.

I want to emphasize how the developers could have made certain things obnoxious, BUT THEY DIDN'T.  I can't emphasize this enough.  Some developers might have added enemies, or more timers, or slower unskippable text, or more obnoxious interfaces to restart challenges.  This one didn't.  Falling off cliffs could be extremely punishing, but it's not.  The result is a game that feels smooth and beautiful, where it's a joy to dive and fly and poke around the island, instead of one where you're stressed and cursing the programmers.

The traversal is smooth and joyful to control, there's never the jank feeling you might get from ""conventional game"" studios. I am especially impressed by the gliding and flying in this that contrary to expectations lands perfectly most of the times.

The atmosphere is as advertised a ""hiking"" experience complete with ambient sounds and relaxingly inoffensive music. It feels like the author has experience and it shows. Add to that a bit of beach vibes, and a cast of animal like people things with indiscernible age groups some implied to be older or younger. The writing could be accused of milennialism, though if you go in with the expectation of encountering young people that is indeed what they would sound like.

On the other hand, it is really short. It's a quality, not quantity experience.

At its heart, it is a game about taking things slow—about finding joy in movement, in discovery, and in the simple beauty of the world around you. The story follows Claire, a young bird visiting Hawk Peak Provincial Park, who learns that the only place she can get cellphone reception is at the summit of the island’s mountain. This modest premise becomes the foundation for an emotional journey of exploration and quiet reflection. There are no villains, no dangers, and no pressing objectives. Instead, A Short Hike invites players to wander, to listen, and to find meaning in the small moments that define the trip to the top.

From the moment you step foot on Hawk Peak, the game’s art direction establishes its warm, inviting tone. The low-poly graphics, reminiscent of early 3D titles from the late ’90s, blend beautifully with the soft color palette and subtle lighting effects. Every inch of the island feels hand-crafted, filled with cozy cabins, winding trails, serene lakes, and the gentle hum of wildlife. The style is nostalgic yet fresh, striking a balance between simplicity and charm. The music and ambient sounds reinforce this atmosphere perfectly. Gentle guitar melodies and soft piano notes flow through the environment, while the sound of waves, footsteps, and rustling leaves create a tactile sense of calm. The audiovisual design is so cohesive that it feels almost meditative, as though the entire island exists to encourage the player to breathe and take in the scenery at their own pace.

The core gameplay revolves around exploration and movement. Claire can run, climb, and glide, and these mechanics feel natural and satisfying from the very start. The more you explore, the more golden feathers you discover—items that act as both stamina upgrades and symbolic tokens of progress. Each feather allows you to climb higher or glide longer, and the sense of growth that comes from collecting them is organic rather than forced. There is no quest log pushing you forward; curiosity alone drives the experience. The act of climbing, reaching new vistas, and soaring through the sky is joyous in itself. Few games manage to make movement feel so liberating. Whether you are gliding across the treetops or diving into a lake below, every motion has a sense of lightness that perfectly mirrors the game’s overall theme of freedom and peace.

While the journey to the summit is the central goal, A Short Hike truly shines in the small, optional stories scattered throughout the island. Along the way, you’ll meet a charming cast of animal characters, each with their own quirks and small troubles. There’s the shy frog selling seashells, the raccoon entrepreneur, and the energetic rabbit who challenges you to a race. These interactions are brief yet memorable, offering humor, kindness, and small glimpses into lives that feel genuine despite their simplicity. Helping these characters often rewards you with items, coins, or feathers, but more importantly, they reinforce the game’s spirit of generosity and connection. Every conversation feels meaningful not because of its impact on gameplay, but because of the warmth it adds to the experience.

The island itself is the game’s greatest achievement—a compact open world that feels alive and rewarding without overwhelming the player. There are hidden caves, fishing spots, treasures buried in the sand, and trails that lead to surprising viewpoints. The level of freedom is remarkable for such a small-scale project. There’s no right way to reach the summit; you can take your time exploring, or you can ascend quickly if you’re eager to see the ending. The pacing is entirely up to you, which gives the experience a relaxed and personal rhythm. Even the structure of the game’s world encourages curiosity rather than completionism. You aren’t punished for missing things; instead, you are gently nudged to enjoy whatever discoveries you stumble upon naturally.

Emotionally, A Short Hike works because of how understated it is. The story of Claire’s climb subtly mirrors real-life experiences of burnout and the need for perspective. Her reason for reaching the summit—a phone call waiting at the top—may seem trivial at first, but by the time you arrive, it carries quiet emotional weight. The game never preaches or dramatizes its message. It simply allows its themes to emerge through play, as if the act of hiking itself becomes a metaphor for taking a break from life’s noise to reconnect with what matters most. The sense of accomplishment at the end isn’t grandiose, but deeply personal—a reminder that even the smallest journeys can feel transformative when approached with patience and openness.

A Short Hike’s brevity is part of its brilliance. It can be completed in a few hours, but those hours feel timeless. Every moment, from the first step up the trail to the final glide from the mountaintop, is infused with care and personality. Some players might wish it lasted longer or offered more complex challenges, but its simplicity is precisely what makes it powerful. It doesn’t overstay its welcome; instead, it lingers in memory as a calm, fleeting experience that leaves you wanting to return to Hawk Peak just to sit by the lake and listen to the wind again.

In the end, A Short Hike is not just a game about climbing a mountain—it’s about rediscovering joy, curiosity, and peace in a world that too often forgets them. It celebrates the beauty of taking your time, of talking to strangers, of pausing to admire the view. Adam Robinson-Yu crafted something rare: a game that feels small in scope but vast in feeling. It’s comforting, funny, and quietly profound, reminding players that sometimes the most meaningful adventures aren’t the epic ones—they’re the short hikes that bring us closer to ourselves.

One of my absolute favorite cozy games, that I wasn't looking for, but it found me, just by randomly stumbling upon its amazing soundtrack. Still to this day, I sometimes catch myself humming the main little music motif that plays throughout the entire game. 

The visuals give it a very Animal Crossing-esque feeling with an exploration type playstyle akin to classic 3D platformers, but the short journey this game takes you on far exceeds any AC games. Hiking your way up towards the mountain's peak, you meet friendly characters with charming dialog that task you with little sidequests and minigames, all culminating towards an ending that completely pulls at your heart strings. You can reach it at your own pace by taking any path you prefer, go straight for the top or fly around exploring as much as you want.

The game ran well with no issues at all during my time with it. the game even had a setting to adjust the pixelization filter which should be default on games that decide to add pixel effects. It is short but if you can get it at $10 or less its is a very solid game.

Pros:
-Consistent collectible difficulty and no extreme difficulty things
-Fun movement once you get enough feathers
-really solid graphics including an option to effectively disable pixelization of the 3d world

cons:
-While the fixed camera angles made sense from a collectibles perspective, I wish I could have had more control of the camera.
-Due to the fixed camera angles, the controls weren’t perfectly implemented when doing certain things such as the boat race.",76561198078942556,0,104,196,0,196,2025-09-13T23:57:02+00:00

-A Short Hike is one of the sweetest games ever made.  It's adorable, heartwarming, and so endearing.  This is a purely positive experience as you make new friends, explore a quaint little island, and go on an adventure that will bring you back to your childhood.  It's no surprise that this game has glowing reviews.  It is extremely short.  I got to the top of the mountain in just under 60 minutes and had completed most of the side quests in under 90 minutes, but that's my only real complaint.  I just wish there was more to discover!

Consensus:
-Excellent Game (Tier 2 and makes up 25% of my reviews).  This game is a must play for cozy explorer's looking for their next adventure.  This game oozes cuteness and is a pleasure to experience.  This is the perfect choice for a Sunday afternoon to brighten your day!",76561198340847703,2048,444,91,0,91,2025-09-01T23:16:44+00:00

The art style is very pretty and nicely stylised, the soundtrack only plays sporadically but when it does it usually has a lot of impact.  The gameplay is chill and low stress while also bringing a sense of playfulness and whimsy to events.  The parkour races add an element of challenge, though I've only found a couple of those so far.

I really wish it had a map though, I have huge issues finding my way around and the compass doesn't help me specifically, I am too noob for that. I would have also preferred being able to use my mouse as well, but at least the game does offer you the possibility of rebinding the keys. I don't think I would have been able to play the game as it was since it was really uncomfortable for me with the base keybindings. The races were tricky which I both hated and enjoyed, overall the game is cozy, but has a tint of competitiveness as well which I appreciated. The characters are nice as well and the interactions are simple, cute and meaningful.",76561199687715194,278,58,215,0,215,2025-08-24T21:09:09+00:00
