The art style is simple, almost harmless, and then the horror hits in ways that feel sharp and creepy.  The gameplay is straightforward explore, solve puzzles, make choices but those choices actually matter. Little details shift depending on what you do, and it makes the whole game feel uneasy, like you’re always one step from a bad outcome. The puzzles are fair, and the atmosphere carries everything. Lacie’s awkward, anxious nature feels real, and it makes the darker moments hit harder. The story doesn’t spell things out, and that works in its favor.

My only nitpick about it is the ending.
It feels very anticlimactic.
It's like a Schrödinger's ending.
It's very ambiguous and straightforward at the same time.

[spoiler]It all depends on if the door actually leads home, and if the ch.2 comes out to expand the story.
If it does, all that journey was pointless, Lacy didn't accomplish anything meaningful and is coming back the same as she left and without Sai, which can only imply she'll be living the same miserable life as before.
On the latter, it's for ch. 2 to catch on and expand further.[/spoiler]

I do hope when the 2nd chapter comes out it's going to be paid, because such good games shouldn't be free.

I thought it's going to be a quick adventure, but honestly, the game itself was far more complicated than I could imagine. Sometimes I even felt lost in what exactly I have to do in order to progress further, but that's exactly what made the game so interesting. If I had to describe it in few words, I am down to say it's literally a work of art. It uses the occult-horror setting of Project Kat and throws in a pinch of fantasy, and it seriously ups the horror with some really scary moments. The atmosphere is incredible - creepy without relying too much on jumpscares. Instead, it uses tension, unsettling visuals, and an eerie soundtrack to create a chilling mood that stays with you. The pixel art is simply beautiful. It's the kind of horror that makes you ask for even more!

The game is engaging, with multiple endings (so far, only one being a ""good"" ending, while the rest depict different ways to die), secrets to discover, and a deep world with lore. There are just so many things you can do to figure out various puzzles, and exploration is where this game shines. While you can fly through it in a couple of hours, taking your time to find everything makes it a much more rewarding experience (Especially for all the achievements hunters out there). The characters are a major plus point too - Lacie, Aoi, and Sai are just so cute, and even the NPCs (Spider, Kozmo, Rune,) have so much personality. I personally loved Miss Knives backstory. It’s honestly ridiculous that a game of this quality is completely free! The authors obviously put their heart and soul into this, and they ought to get all the support they can get. If this is only Chapter 1, I don't know how I'm going to manage to wait for whatever comes next.

Holy shit dudes, i instantly fell in love with this game. INSTANTLY. Lacie is just so adorable, i want to protect her at all cost.

I really like that while the game is heavily dealing with depressive topics, and our main girl also suffers from depression. The game doesn't feel like doomposting just to farm bad emotions for no reason, the main driving force is ""There is always a way"" and i really  hope we keep that mentality till the end. I want to see Lacie happy.

Story is interesting, i want to learn more about what is going on in this world we explore.

Gameplay is pretty fun, And the game has it's own style that helps it break away from ""RPG maker feel"" it feels like a proper game made by people who have the passion for it. Keep up the good work devs!

Music is also really good, It even has layers like an onion in certain areas! 

Oh yeah! This is a puzzle game too! And the puzzles are pretty nice. Liked those a lot as well.

But the real question is..

Are you just going to stand there and watch or are you going to download Paper Lily and help Lacie find answers and happiness?",76561198013299321,338,42,661,0,484,2025-11-16T17:51:48+00:00

Since I really liked this game, I think they need some criticism to become great developers which I'd really love to see. They have a great talent. Let's begin.

For a 2-person team, they managed to make an incredible game. At the beginning, I always asked myself if the gameplay of this game was just an RPGM game with some more advanced niches. The ending segment of the game shoved those words right back into my mouth lol.

Firstly, let me start with the praises. Art style is great. Even though, as I said before, it felt like playing an RPGM game, since it’s made with Godot, the graphics are much cleaner. Not that special, but since it doesn't have that many engine limitations, it looked great.

The music is incredible, though. I probably won’t listen to them outside of the game, but while playing it, they’re really well made and deliberately used.

Interactions with the overworld and how you can approach solving puzzles are really impressive. There are many details when you interact before and after certain events. Some of the puzzles also have multiple choices—which aren’t some cheap ways to do it.

The story only got interesting after mid-game and at the beginning of the ending. The prequel really got me interested in the beginning, but Chapter 1 really failed this time. If I hadn’t liked playing indie games, I probably would’ve dropped it, to be honest. But with the ending premise and after-credits scenes, I’m interested in it again like I was with the prequel.

Okay, these are the things I can praise. Now it’s time for the criticism side.

Firstly, as I mentioned before, the beginning of the story isn’t that interesting or great. Our heroine Lacie’s introduction felt really shallow. Also, she isn’t that much of an interesting character either. Design-wise, unlike the previous game, it felt like this is some kind of OC story project. Prequel heroine Kat didn’t have much to her, but still managed to be more likeable with how she could interact and respond. The other character, Sei, is the same as well. Felt like he’s there just because of the story’s buildup—and with the ending, I can see that.

Horror/chase segments need more polishing. Most of the time, you can’t react since enemies literally instakill you unless you know what would happen beforehand. Also, outside of RPGM mechanics, the game needs polishing as well. Puzzles are okay, but chase and combat(?) segments are really just watered-down versions of other popular games that use the same mechanics (maybe too close to Everhood and Helltaker’s segments—this isn’t a bad thing per se, it just needs more polish). But compared to them, it feels like something's missing.

And lastly, performance-wise, the game runs great most of the time, but some segments really pushed my laptop to its limits, and I don’t know why. Unlike some other indies made with Godot, this game has a settings section, but it’s not that complete. I had to lower my initial resolution before playing the game.

Overall, I finished this game with satisfaction. They managed to pull the game together in the mid-final stages. I’m really interested to see how the story goes. Since this is a two-person team game, I can forgive many things about it, and I can’t wait to see Chapter 2. It has great potential to become a great series.",76561199512066815,0,37,65,0,65,2025-03-10T20:25:50+00:00

Compared to Project Kat, this sequel truly feels like a big step forward. It’s more polished, more ambitious, and even more captivating. What I love most is how, while solving mysteries, the game constantly leaves you with new questions and doubts, making the experience even more intriguing.

I usually try to avoid it because I think that unless you actually write something about the game pros and cons, it doesn’t make much sense to leave a review. I get a little annoyed when I’m trying to find a good review but end up reading only bad ones (like most of the negative reviews), or even the positive ones that are just jokes and don’t help anyone in deciding whether to try the game or not. At least those don’t harm the game and sometimes give me a chuckle, so I don’t really have a problem with them. Anyway, with that out of the way, let’s get to the review.

I find Paper Lily to be quite a charming and interesting game. I really like that there are multiple ways to solve puzzles. I don’t dislike puzzles, but I do find it pretty annoying when there’s only one specific way the developer intended you to do something (especially without many hints). The game also has some combat similar to Undertale, the sections are not that hard. There’s even a skip button in case you get stuck or annoyed a good feature, in my opinion. I personally didn’t use it (except in GTA 5 during a helicopter mission, i just really hate those controls), so I don’t really get why people hate this feature. Like most RPG horror games, Paper Lily has secrets to discover, and of course, you’re not going to see everything the game has to offer in one playthrough. I actually like that, it gives me a reason to play again and see what I missed. The graphics are quite nice, and the music is lovely. The horror parts didn’t really scare me, but the atmosphere was good. I might have been surprised once or twice, but that’s about it. Then again, I’ve played quite a few horror games (Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Rebirth, The Bunker, Outlast, Penumbra: Overture and Black Plague, etc.), so it doesn’t mean these parts are bad. As for the story, I can’t really say much, this is just the first chapter, so there isn’t that much yet. There are definitely things to discuss about the lore and the world , but I’m not going to write paragraphs about it here. It’s better if you experience it yourself in the game at least that’s how I prefer it.

Well, that was my review. I hope it helps you decide whether to try the game or not and have fun if you do!

The art and atmosphere are extremely good, and the gameplay is not any worse. 

The puzzles are unique and, as advertised, have several substantially different solutions. If you can think of some strange way of solving a puzzle, then it will *probably* work in the game and let you progress without even noticing the several different ways you could have achieved the same result. 

Unlike many rpgmaker-esque puzzle games, there is little possibility of getting stuck without direction, the objectives which the game displays, combined with the very open approaches to puzzles allows you to progress very smoothly.

The game is also FILLED with missable details, interactions, and characters. There are loads of optional side activities and puzzles which you very well may not even realize you are progressing until you suddenly complete them by chance. These can often introduce entirely new characters, and even provide items which can give you unique solutions to future puzzles. Exploring thoroughly and figuring out uses for EVERYTHING in your inventory is very rewarding in this game.

Now, the main character, Lacie. I find her, very, VERY likeable. Her backstory and personality does a very good job at both setting up the stakes in the story and making your care about everything that happens to her. I found myself very much worrying for her safety and emotions throughout the game and genuinely feeling awful whenever she met any nasty ends (Of which there is no shortage of). She might be my highlight of the game by far, and, of course, her design is very cute. The other characters are quite entertaining as well, though they have had quite a bit less time to shine than Lacie.

And the story which Lacie finds herself in? While the chapter's story mostly revolves around Lacie and has very good intrigue built up throughout, it unbelievably shines at certain points, especially in the beautiful cutscenes with art. It would be spoiling to go on deeper, but trust me: the game is very, very good at making you care for characters and their backstories, all of which culminates in an incredible final sequence which could fit right in Touhou. 

Oh yeah, speaking of that, the game isn't just walking, plot, and puzzles. There are a few (light) chase sequences, some (lighter) stealth sections, and bullet minigames which are very, very fun. (And it even lets you skip them since they aren't a walk in the park!)

I love this game, and can't wait for chapter 2.",76561198954494116,60,24,486,0,403,2025-10-24T19:12:19+00:00

The atmosphere is one of the strongest parts. The music, art style, and sound design work really well together to create tension without relying too much on cheap jump scares. The puzzles are fun and rewarding, though a few can be a bit confusing at times.

I cannot stretch to you how much I love this exact type of game.
It's the type of game that makes me want to it explore fully, every nook and cranny checked, every tiny detail saved to a file, to later speculate and form theories on, or perhaps use in the future chapters..

The worldbuilding is very good so far, the dialogues are engaging, ones that you actively want to read, to hear every little bit there is. The artstyle is PERFECT! I love it way too much..
I went into this game without any prior expirience of pixel 2d horrors like this before, and I have to say, it totally did not dissapoint. The horror elements truly feel scary, and the thrill is amazing to feel.

The storytelling, as well as the musical accompaniment, I feel deserve a special mention. The music is so beautiful, that I just have to stop whatever I'm doing just to appreciate it. The literal FOURTH track I heard, ""Wistful - Sunset"" made me cry. I just stood outside the house and did nothing, just lost in the beauty of the music. The same happened with multiple tracks across the game, save for the crying. [strike]yes, i did get the music box achievement without knowing there was a music box achievement.[/strike]

As for the storytelling.. I cried even more, specifically in the later part of chapter 1. Almost any game that is able to make you feel genuine sorrow like that, I feel like deserves to be loved and cherished. And what follows after you learn that story, the [spoiler]action of a full-on battle[/spoiler], the [spoiler]thrill[/spoiler], accompanied by one of the best osts, is just simply amazing. The earlier parts also do not go by without mention - the whole beginning of the game, before the forest, the build-up, is played out perfectly. 

I love that I can get more information by being thorough. It makes me feel rewarded for checking everything. Though some of the more obscure puzzles may be hard, it feels like they're solvable, you can figure out what to do if you're simply observant enough, and thorough enough to check all dead ends..
After playing through the game once, I immediately started another playthrough, where I would do [b]anything[/b] that i didn't do in my first. [spoiler]Get off the bus? How about no?; Chips? Sure, I'll eat them.[/spoiler]; etc. The dead ends, though seemingly not worth going for at first, actually provide quite a bit of insight..

Okay, I've been rambling for long enough now... I may have fangirled too hard. I can't compliment this game enough.
For a free game, this is simply too good. If the future chapters cost anything, I'll pay whatever amount of money.
I hope this game gets more recognition. I sincerely hope this project will come to fruition, for this beautiful game to be realized, and brought into existence. For a small team of just two developers, you're doing spectacularly!
10/10. I will patiently wait for future chapters.",76561198957201919,39,4,1479,0,1107,2025-08-31T03:24:40+00:00

The game follows a girl named Lacie, who finally steps outside after months of isolating herself at home, probably due to bullying she experienced at school. Long story short, she decides to perform a ritual by taking a mysterious bus at night, which eventually leads her to a forest.

The game does a great job at creating a horror feel—not just through creepy creatures but also through Lacie's past and the overall atmosphere. The dark forest, strange entities, and moments where the music suddenly stops whenever something weird happens... It really builds up the tension.

Also mir wurde zufällig das Spiel auf Steam vorgeschlagen, ich fand das Cover und die Screenshots sehr interessant und dann ist es auch noch kostenlos, da musste ich einfach zuschlagen und es mir mal anschauen, ich mag ja generell schon solche RPG Horror Spiele. Ich habe fürs durchspielen ungefähr 6h gebraucht, werde es aber definitiv nochmal spielen um alle Errungenschaften zu bekommen. Ich bin ziemlich oft gestorben, teils beabsichtigt, teils unbeabsichtigt haha, aber es hat auf jeden fall wirklich viel Spaß gemacht.

Was ich gut fand: 
- Artworks, die waren echt super und haben mir echt gut gefallen, könnte jetzt nicht mal sagen von welchen Charakter ich das Design am meisten mochte, mochte an sich von jedem die sehr
- Die Soundtracks, ich höre nicht in vielen Spielen die Musik, bei dem Spiel war es allerdings eine Ausnahme, was ich damit sagen will, dass sie unglaublich atmosphärisch und schön ist
- Die Charaktere, jeder Charakter war für mich auf seine oder ihre Weise einzigartig, und manche Posen fande ich echt cute von manchen Charakteren, speziell aber von Lacie und Aoi
- Die Umgebungen, die waren auch wunderschön, hab mir ein paar Screenshots gemacht für Wallpaper ^^'
- Der Preis, well das Paper Lily - Chapter 1 ist kostenlos, also besser geht es ja gar nicht, besonders für den Content und für die Spielzeit die man in dem Spiel hat. Das Chapter 1 von diesem Game hat vom Gefühl her mehr Content als manch andere Spiele die Geld kosten
- Spielzeit, well wie gesagt es waren bei mir 6h, was ich bei den anderen gesehen habe, die hier auch rezensionen geschrieben haben, war es aber auch recht ähnlich, als da gibts nichts zu meckern bei 6h Spielzeit, beim wohlgemerkten normal durchspielen, da kommt noch Zeit dazu, wenn du alles sammeln und Errungenschaften jagen willst
- die Story, meiner Meinung nach ist sie sehr interessant und hat mich quasi hineingezogen, ich mochte das Setting sehr, also dass es um Rituale, Dämonen usw. geht und mochte es auch, dass nicht alle negativ gestimmt waren
- Rätsel, die waren größtenteils verständlich, bei manchen musste ich 2mal drüber nachdenken wie es gelöst wird, aber am Ende hab ich es dann immer geschafft, sie sind nicht besonders schwer, aber auch nicht kindereinfach, trifft eigentlich genau das, was ich so von der Schwierigkeit mag
- Endings, naja dazu werde ich nicht viel sagen da ich ungern Spoilern möchte, aber es gibt viele, wirklich viele, mochte ich sehr
- wenn ich noch was vergessen haben sollte, dann alles andere, gab eigentlich nichts, was ich nicht mochte

Ich hatte auch Project Kat gespielt, zwar erst hinterher, aber besser spät als nie haha, würde empfehlen Project Kat zuerst zu spielen, auch weil es der Prologue ist und danach dann Paper Lily, aber auf jeden fall würde ich beides empfehlen, ich hab es wirklich sehr genossen, das Spiel zu spielen. Ich freue mich schon sehr auf Chapter 2 und danke, dass ihr das Spiel macht, ist ja nicht selbstverständlich, ich wünsche einen schönen Tag oder Abend, je nach dem wann man das hier liest c:

English:

This game got randomly recommended to me on Steam. The cover art and screenshots immediately caught my eye—and since it’s also free, I just had to give it a try. I’m generally a big fan of RPG horror games, so this was right up my alley.

It took me about 6 hours to finish my first playthrough, but I’ll definitely replay it to unlock all achievements. I died a lot—sometimes on purpose, sometimes not (oops) —but honestly, I had a ton of fun the whole time.

What I liked:

The artwork – absolutely gorgeous. I genuinely can’t even pick a favorite character design because I liked all of them.

The soundtrack – I don’t usually pay much attention to music in games, but this one was a real exception. It’s incredibly atmospheric and beautiful.

The characters – everyone felt unique in their own way, and some character poses were really cute—especially Lacie and Aoi.

The environments – also stunning. I ended up taking a bunch of screenshots for wallpapers. ^^’

The price – it’s free, which is honestly crazy considering the amount of content and playtime. Chapter 1 alone feels like it has more content than some paid games.

Playtime – like I said, it was around 6 hours for me, and from what I’ve seen in other reviews, that seems pretty consistent. And that’s just a normal playthrough—if you go for collectibles and achievements, you’ll easily spend more time.

The story – in my opinion, it’s really interesting and pulled me in quickly. I loved the setting (rituals, demons, etc.), and I really liked that the demons weren't all hostile towards Lacie.

Puzzles – mostly straightforward. A few made me stop and think for a moment, but I always figured them out in the end. Not too easy, not frustratingly hard—pretty much the perfect difficulty for me.

Endings – I won’t say much because I don’t want to spoil anything, but there are many endings. Like, really many. I loved that.

And if I forgot anything: basically everything else, because there wasn’t really anything I disliked.

I also played Project Kat (only afterwards—better late than never). I’d recommend playing Project Kat first since it’s the prologue, and then Paper Lily—but honestly, I’d recommend both either way. I genuinely enjoyed my time with these games.

I’m really looking forward to Chapter 2. Thank you for making this—things like this aren’t a given. Wishing you a lovely day or evening, whenever you’re reading this. c:",76561199105166226,222,6,355,355,355,2026-01-29T04:27:00+00:00

I played this right after playing through Project Kat and thankfully even if you haven't played that game it's fine since they don't really seem to connect besides the golden letter. But that's also one of my biggest complaints too. Besides from the letters making a comeback and the rituals, this game really has nothing to do with the first. I'm assuming that's how this series is going to be as a whole. Just a bunch of random stories from different people that somewhat loosely take place in the same universe. This game compared to Project Kat just felt a little... off. Project Kat had a perfect balance of horror and mystery in it. Things seemed much more grounded and easy to follow. Paper Lily Chapter one often felt confusing and there was a lot of times I found myself saying, ""what even happened?"" Each game will tell you that there's always another way to do something but I surprisingly felt like this game was more linear than Project Kat. Most other solutions straight up just lead to death or some confusing unescapable faith like with the fairy circle, and yes, I know that there is a way out. But unless you actually looked it up beforehand, it's literally impossible for a first time player to ever figure this stuff out. Someone had to make a full length guide on how to do this because at one point only 1% of players even obtained the achievement. I just don't like those kinds of games and I felt this one strayed too far from Project Kat. I felt like Project Kat had set up a really good story and theme for what the series could be and unfortunately it kind of went to waste. I did still like the game. I like the artstyle, the characters, and the clear dedication put into this game but it just didn't hit as hard for me. But it's still worth checking out either way. I can see why people would love these things, it's just not for me.",76561198117824327,0,7,326,0,326,2026-01-04T01:24:06+00:00

The atmosphere is definitely my favourite part of the game though, it's hauntingly beautiful in a fantastic way!

Paper Lily Chapter 1 is a beautifully well-made game. It's incredibly rich in storytelling and replay-ability due to the multiple endings. Each character is unique and memorable, my favorite is Aoi. 
For a free game, I think it could be an indie darling. It even had a free prologue.

If you like Undertale, Oneshot, Rakuen and the Freebird games you should definitely give this a try.

I honestly wouldn't mind paying for the next chapters, seeing how much i enjoyed the first one. 

Also, the game has a really cool atmosphere, the best one is by far in the forest. BUT, i wish the spooky parts were a little spookier - the music hits just right, the timing and changing of scenes is just perfect, but the monsters were really not that deformed or creepy, and honestly if the lore was more deep on the scary part, it would add SO MUCH to the scary parts.

I remember playing undertale and being really scared of dr. alphys lab, but not for the fact of it being somehow more scary, i was just spooked by the lore and the weirdness of that place, not understanding whats going on and trying to figure it out and get out as quick as possible. I lacked that feeling here - I never felt like being stuck because of not wanting to encounter monsters or going through a scary part. It was a good psychological horror, just lacked some deeper, in terms of scary, lore or maybe a better way to make the player feel like the lore is really scary i guess.",76561198315552478,147,8,381,0,381,2025-11-24T20:28:56+00:00

I like the game provide you with multiple solutions to proceed.

Some of the solution might not be obvious, but it give you reason to play this game for multiple times.

The puzzle are not too easy and not too difficult.

This game also give you choice to skip some of chase scene & battle, so it is good for people with skills issue, who like to focus on the story only.


[h3]CHARACTER[/h3]
I like all of the character in this game.
Main character, ally & villain.

They all have unique personality & memorable.
Lots of funny & cute moment.

I loved the variety of location & atmosphere in this game.

I also loved how the gamedev put balance in horror element & beautiful scenery.

Paper Lily has always been a great game and I think it should have more attention to it. The themes it has , the graphics , the storyline and overall everything is so good and detailed , it is very clear they put a lot of effort in this game.
If you're not good at puzzles ( as I am ) you might need some help or a guide to get you through the chapters but like that's all and despite that ,  it really is worth playing because not only it has a great storyline , the characters are so easily relatable and it expresses the human emotions and struggles many go through and it so nice to see something like that in a game because it makes people feel seen and appreciated and that is all that matters imo.
I really look foward to chapter 2 / the second game

I'm impressed as how they managed to create a ""linear"" storyline with so much details and alternate routes, althought this can be enjoyed on it's own, I believe it is CRUCIAL to have played Project Kat, at least the ""tutorial"" sequence, to understand the message and ""philosophy"" of this game's desing. There is always another way.
I believe as the game is right now, the puzzles are really fine in difficulty and save points/slots are sufficient. I could figure out at least some 70%-ish of the content by my own on my blind playthrough at least. I think this is just right for the chapter's lenght.

Every aspect of the game is finely crafted.  The story is highly intriguing and is based upon Lacie's efforts to cure her unusual condition that is of apparently supernatural origin by performing a ritual that, hopefully, will ultimately lead to answers.  The writing is excellent and there are several interesting and memorable characters.     

There is an abundance of lore to be discovered through inspecting objects, exploration, talking to characters and completing tasks for them, and obtaining various endings.  One particularly impressive feature of Paper Lily is the game's extremely high level of interactivity and vast number of character reactions and scenes.  Additionally, there are a large number of possible dead end endings alongside the true ending, with the latter setting the stage for Chapter 2.    

This game also features numerous decisions and in some cases the player's choices are referenced later and/or affect for which specific items are available or not.  It also seems very likely that several of the player's actions or decisions made in Chapter 1 will carry over to future chapters.  

The phrase ""There is always another way"" appears frequently within the game and, indeed, it is very frequently that are multiple ways to go about completing or tasks or gaining access to new areas.  The gameplay contains a variety of puzzles and various events alongside exploration, item collection, stealth sections, and interacting with characters.  

The music and art are also top notch and fit the game perfectly.  The art style for the characters and the sprites are especially good. 

Paper Lily is a top tier game.  Everything about it is very good, including the narrative, characters, lore, writing in general, the numerous and often consequential decisions, fine gameplay, superb art, and excellent music.

I had to use a guide just to complete it in six hours. Despite this, the game was a fantastic experience, and I'm excited for the next chapter of the game.

Btw, the game is better than most current release of modern AAA slop. I assure you that your time will be worthwhile.",76561198362112346,113,95,369,0,369,2025-09-23T19:58:30+00:00

Never have I ever fallen in love with a game faster than with Paper Lily! From the get-go, the story is captivating without being too convoluted to follow-perfect for people trying to get into RPG Maker-type games. Character interactions are witty while not being too obnoxious (I like the dynamic between Lacie, Rune, and Sai most especially). The puzzle mechanics are well thought-out and the optional skip is welcome for players not fussed enough to solve them. The game's art and music direction are superb with the overworld being at a sweet spot between too simplistic and overly-detailed. Only wished the game was longer.

QOL Changes necessary but this is only their second title and therefore I am sure that Chapter 2 will be more polished. 

Pros: 
- The art style as well as the soundtrack are perfect. This is both in dialogue images as they speak, as well as the pixel character that you play as. 
- I, personally, am a huge fan of the dialogue. I love how many dialogue interactions there are for 'pointless' things, such as observing a painting. It was funny at parts and the personalities of the characters were actually admirable. I am not a huge fan of games like this but I read absolutely everything that was said, read all of the prompted text when interacting with pages or books and in general enjoyed the writing and the story... (until the end). 
- You can skip boss fights/puzzles if you find them too hard or frustrating. This comes in useful for both replayability and the very prevalent skill issue I have. 
- I love how many secrets there are in the game (despite their cons mentioned later). It's very interesting to see how each option will pan out, or all the different interactions that specific items will give you. 
- I can't believe that this game is free! It is the best free game I've come across. QOL changes are necessary in terms of UI, gameplay and generally helping the player, but I can imagine this to only get better as their titles pad out. 
- Sai is cute :] 

Cons:
- Surprisingly heavy on the PC, temperatures sky-rocket with the game open. 
- A lot of pathways rely on VERY precise patterns of actions. This is fun for those who play it once-through and can feel that their actions have genuine consequences. However, I feel that a lot of interactions being locked behind previous ""stage"" progress doesn't feel as OBVIOUS. For example: the game will tell you to collect 3 items, 2 of them are readily available but the third can only be obtained had you kept an item from 2 hours ago, in a ""yes or no"" selection sequence. There are no indicators that due to your option being ""incorrect"" for this interaction, that you will never be able to pursue this pathway without a reload. This is just quite frustrating. It still leads you to the True Ending, if that's what you are aiming for, but it would be nice to not waste a good 10-30 minutes pathing around for an item which is unobtainable at that stage of the game. 
- Considering the depth of the story as you're playing, the True Ending is very lacklustre and makes it feel almost a waste of doing all of these puzzles and traversing through the game as you're not rewarded with absolutely anything. I assume that it was made this way to ensure that you play Chapter 2 to answer the ambiguity of the situation but it just feels more of a let-down than a cliffhanger. 
- Not a fan of how drawn-out some of the dead-ends are. To avoid spoilers, I will be vague, but there is a good section that is 15-20 minutes of looping around puzzles, dying constantly in ambiguous mazes only to come out that the entire sequence was your inevitable death and save reset anyway. 
- The keyboard controls aren't necessarily uncomfortable, but I'd have preferred being able to navigate the dialogue options etc. by clicking and moving my mouse rather than everything being done through arrow keys/WASD. 
- I wish that there were different death sequences other than just a red blood splatter on the screen that takes a few seconds to fade (especially considering just how many times you will die).",76561199043631209,246,43,392,0,392,2025-09-10T13:17:30+00:00

The story about a girl who doesn't fit in or is ostracized by people around her is a classic and this game does it well with not just Lacie but one character later on that I won't go to spoilers on.

I appreciate the multiple endings you can come across and the different ways you can complete chapter 1. Most rpg-maker-like games feel too narrow in the gameplay department, but this game does a good job of skipping through long segments if you're adventurous/patient enough. Hell you can do a side quest which might unlock some companions to play with in the later chapters.

The prologue of this game (Project Kat) outright tells you that the choices you make matter and shows it from the very beginning. I feel that the main game somewhat strays off the path by making every non Dead End, ending the same. Project Kat has multiple endings that either lead to death or you escaping without doing the ritual fully. 2 endings in particular show the consequences of bringing friends along the ritual and the true ending where Kat dies alone. These two endings really show that doing this ritual was the biggest mistake of your life, neveetheless disregarding the rules of the ritual. But one ending has all of Kat's friends survive as well as herself after being warned by a hooded figure (presumably also Kat). Point being, the variety of endings really felt like your choices mattered and you could get a somewhat happy but unfulfilling ending. 

Paper Lily does have impactful Dead End, endings such as Sai dying because of your distrust towards him,or your own ""brother"" killing you on your bed. I guess it just didn't hit as well like in Project Kat",76561199157707608,0,11,919,0,762,2025-12-21T00:23:15+00:00

(Like in Miss Knives house I searched for quite a while to find where the small key goes into, when I already had freed Sai from the dungeon with a lockpick.) The ""combat encounters"", if you could even call it that, were also fun and the bossfight with miss knives was extremely fun and although I died quite a lot, it was enjoyable and only very mildly frustrating.

This is one of the best indie games i have ever played. The Best things about this game are :
-beautiful art style, 
-great character design and writing, 
-soundtrack that is just blessing for the ears, 
-story that is easy to follow but also very deep if you immerse yourself in it a bit more,
-most puzzles are enjoyable and creative, 
-and tranquilizer chips. 
No seriously i bought 5 bags of it and tried to give it to every character to see their reaction.

The only somewhat bad thing about this game is that few puzzles cannot be solved without 50h of trial and error or help from tutorial or walkthrough. BUT those puzzles aren't even required to beat the full game, they are only there for nice little secrets and steam achievements.


Overall Paper Lily is great franchise with long road ahead of it. I cant wait to see what chapter 2 might look like. 
But for now this game is 10/10 would recommend to anyone.",76561198404467192,142,3,586,0,586,2025-05-07T12:36:18+00:00

The early half has a lot of project kat-isms that made me apprehensive going into it but there is a pretty clear cutoff point where the game really starts to come into its own to the point where I almost feel like the direction of the game took a turn for the better somewhere along the line through development.
The game isnt without its fair share of flaws, there are a lot of spots where it isnt clear what you're meant to be doing or even really looking for and it does trip over itself sometimes with where you have to be standing to use an item on something, but all in all it didnt detract too heavily from the experience, there weren't too too many of those spots and the ones that did arise never made me feel like I needed to seek out a guide to progress (except for Stone Curse Cure stuff but thats optional). 
If you're interested in this series, I genuinely recommend skipping project kat and starting here, and if you REALLY want more of this then project kat is always there to look back on and appreciate how far they ended up coming since then. I personally felt kinda duped playing project kat first because it didnt really setup anything going into this game and the stories didnt tie in at all, project kat felt more like a tech demo of this than anything else. Not knowing the events of project kat wont detract from your experience and knowing the events of project kat wont elevate your experience either, maybe that'll change with later chapters but for now just start here.
All in all definitely look forward to see where this series ends up going, and to the future of its developers",76561198316335051,0,19,542,0,542,2025-08-06T04:14:41+00:00

Critique:
-Finding ""Runes"" is needed to unlock tools to progress
-Note that some of these ""Runes"" are hidden too well without adequate hints of finding them
-If you miss on a rune from previous Location, you might be stuck in future Location due to not having enough Runes to trade into tools needed to progress. [You will need to reload/replay certain Location if you do]

i also i just wanted to take note of the artstyle / ui, theres something about the blend of pixel graphics of the game itself and then the smoother higher res ui and drawings and character protraits and stuff that i just find really neat, like i believe usually a pixel art styled game is going to be completely pixeled down to the ui and text and stuff, very cool to see this one break that rule

The game mainly features a pixel-art-style, which I love, the menus, dialogues, the dialogue character sprites and cutscenes are illustrated beautifully in non-pixel-art assets. The music is really nice throughout the game and the sound effects are on-point and immersive.
[h2]Gameplay[/h2]
The game is perfect the first time you play it. Almost every object can be interacted with even if it can't be used and you can basically do anything you want without following the main story, which actually leads to different endings (there are plenty of them). I also like the fact that there are more than one solutions to most problems/riddles. The controls are okay for me and I think you can even change them if you like. The game also has many mini-games here and there which are enjoyable and not too challenging for casual gamers [spoiler]example: the spike mini-game at Red's treehouse[/spoiler] (If the mini-games are too hard for you, there is an option to skip them). The only problem is that after your first playthrough, if you are going for completion of all achievements, like I did, it gets fairly repetitive and even a bit boring. My suggestion to fix this is to add fast-travel and more convenient save-points.
[h2]Story[/h2]
The story is very good and fairly long for a [b]free[/b] game and I really enjoyed the way it unfolded.
Here is the story in short:
[spoiler]Lacie, a socially isolated girl burdened by a mysterious curse, receives a golden letter guiding her to perform a ritual. This leads her into a parallel world inhabited by demons and enigmatic entities. Seeking to lift her curse, she learns she must reach a lighthouse where someone named Red can help. Along her journey, she befriends Rune, a kindhearted demon, and encounters Sai, a peculiar human. Her path takes a dark turn when she stumbles upon a facility where demons conduct disturbing experiments. source:[url=https://paper-lily.fandom.com/wiki/Paper_Lily_Wiki]https://paper-lily.fandom.com/wiki/Paper_Lily_Wiki[/url][/spoiler]
[h2]Achievements[/h2]
Unlike the prologue (Project Kat), there are some achievements that are almost impossible to find without a guide and the not-so-convenient save-points make it very time consuming to try and find them on your own. Personally I used a guide for the following achievements: Safer Path, Omochikaeri!, Electrician, Queen of Fools
[h2]Conclusion[/h2]
The game is great with no bugs, smooth gameplay and a very nice story. I would definitely recommend this game, especially to people who like rpg games and ones with good stories. The game is made by a indie team of just two people btw which makes it even better. I am looking forward to chapter 2!!!!",76561199203203507,0,20,629,0,629,2025-06-01T22:20:18+00:00

The story and characters are incredible, and it honestly feels like a complete game on its own.

At first, I wasn’t sure I’d connect with the story or the main character, but by the end, I genuinely cared about her journey—watching her start to find love and appreciation for herself, the world, and the characters she meets was beautiful.

The game gives off strong Undertale vibes—not just in tone, but in how your actions define who you are. Even though it’s just Chapter 1, there’s already a lot to do. The world is super immersive: the music pulls you in, and everything feels carefully crafted. You’re encouraged to click on everything, and in doing so, you’ll find tons of funny dialogues, hidden easter eggs, and surprises. The developers clearly thought ahead and predicted player actions, which makes the experience even better.

And then there are the puzzles—lots of them! Some are optional, some are required, but combined with the exploration, they make you want to look at every detail to complete them all.

My recommendation for the developers: next time, charge at least $2 for the game—it’s easily worth that and more.
If you want to support the creators, consider buying the supporter pack. They absolutely deserve it.",76561199280724232,0,17,421,0,421,2025-05-04T21:59:29+00:00

I’ve already played for more than 17 hours, and will keep replaying this game because I can always find some new paths, events, or other secrets, which are so rewarding and refreshing.

The final boss wasn't amazing but not bad aswell because it was pretty long for a kinda easy bossfight, should've been a bit harder, dificulty wise it's a 4/10 but imo should be around 7/10.
The fairy ring section is quite punishive as you basically ""waste"" around 20 minutes of your time for a dead end (if you don't have the fishes that is) but I'm okay with that since it was well designed and fun to get through.
Honestly the only thing that I actually disliked in this game is the death animation, since it's just a splatter of blood in a black background, but not really worth mentioning

Upsides:

Great story that keeps you curious

Cool visuals and sound design

Lots of little interactions and hidden stuff

The vibe is just so good

I rarely write recommendations on any platform - I am hoping that the fact that I am taking the time to put thoughts to paper on a free title helps convey how much of a hidden gem this is. The free price tag is deceptive for the amount of content and the quality this title holds. I picked this up after completing the free prologue, Project: Kat, because that title really drew me in despite its short playtime however, the prologue is not a requirement to understand this game. 

I was quickly captivated with the amazing soundtrack, atmosphere, stunning art, and of course the puzzles. Once again, things you do and do not do can lead you down a certain ending but these aren’t too punishing, and I found myself trying to see them all since some of these give more context that you wouldn’t normally get – case in point, there are characters that you only meet on these paths that are otherwise absent in the main path. While I have made it to the end credits, I’m sitting around 5 hours and I did miss quite a few things, another play through to get what I missed the first time around would net me around the nine-hour mark – which for a free game isn’t bad at all. I am eagerly looking forward to Chapter 2.

- In between platforms, I have played well over 50 hours of this game by now, and I love it. I've gone through about 20 playthroughs and I believe I've managed to play them each uniquely, as there are just so many hidden details and lore. The story explores a lot of Japanese mythology elements whilst keeping a good balance between our modern world and the supernatural world. The stage is set, beautifully, and our protagonist is likable and fun to play as. I can only imagine how much the next chapters will expand on!
- There were many instances when I needed to take a moment to appreciate the landscape and character designs, the fluidity of the movement and surprisingly expressive pixel art. Sometimes, fully illustrated panels would come up during dialogue, other times there would be special effects breathing life into the scenes... Every detail is accounted for and serves a purpose.
- Both the visuals and the sound effects are really evocative, often providing clues as to how we could solve certain puzzles. I quite liked the soundtrack, it followed the mood shifts and tribulations I would face, as well as provide a really cozy ambiance while I wracked my brain looking for answers.
- Something I always love to see in a game like this is more accessible options, for more casual players or people in need of more accommodations. And when it comes to dexterity tasks, it allows the player to skip that minigame (which is pretty neat). It also graciously offers many different ways to solve the same problem, and that really comes in clutch when you mess something up.
- This is definitely not an easy game, it takes time and it challenges the mind. But for those who fancy a good puzzle and those with the patience to overcome it, this is a must play! I truly recommend this game, might have just been me but it gave me a lot of food for thought and I found myself dwelling on many of the characters' lines. It takes a special game to touch one's heart, and as I did not find a single bug or issue, it warrants a perfect score.",76561199749551176,0,10,936,0,936,2025-02-08T23:04:33+00:00

Paper Lily - Chapter 1 took me by surprise. What at first seemed like a simple pixel horror game slowly unfolded into something far more personal, atmospheric, and quietly impactful. It’s the kind of experience that doesn’t need loud scares or flashy effects to leave a mark — it lingers through tone, subtle storytelling, and an almost dreamlike melancholy.

The presentation is striking in its minimalism. The soft, muted pixel art gives everything a delicate, eerie quality, and the sound design — sparse, ambient, and intentionally subdued — reinforces the game’s intimate atmosphere. It’s not about overwhelming you with terror; it’s about making you feel just a little bit off, a little bit small in a strange and unsettling world.

The gameplay is simple but effective. Exploration is at the heart of it — investigating strange places, solving light puzzles, and uncovering bits of story through careful observation. There are no real jump scares or high-stakes chases, but there’s a persistent sense of dread, like something is watching from just out of frame.

Where Paper Lily really shines is in its character work. Lacie is a protagonist who feels grounded and vulnerable, and her journey — however cryptic it may seem at first — carries an emotional weight that sneaks up on you. The writing doesn’t hold your hand, and it often trusts the player to sit with ambiguity and make sense of things on their own. That restraint works in its favor.

It's a short experience, but it knows exactly what it wants to be. There’s a confidence in its tone and pacing that makes every small moment feel intentional. It’s a game that respects your attention and rewards curiosity, and by the end, I found myself far more emotionally invested than I expected going in.

If you’re into low-key psychological horror, quiet worldbuilding, and emotionally charged mysteries told through atmosphere more than exposition, Paper Lily - Chapter 1 is absolutely worth your time. It’s not just a promising start — it’s a statement. I’ll be there for Chapter 2.
