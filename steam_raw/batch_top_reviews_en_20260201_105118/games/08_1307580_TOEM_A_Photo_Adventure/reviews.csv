Each area feels distinct and offers its own charm, giving players a fresh experience every time they hop on the bus. There’s a surprising amount to photograph, and before long, I found myself instinctively snapping shots of objects and moments that turned out to be tied to quests, even when I wasn’t sure. For the most part, Toem makes it clear when you should interact or take photos, keeping the flow of exploration smooth and satisfying. The biggest drawback, though, is its brief runtime. I was honestly surprised when the credits rolled so soon I would’ve loved one or two more regions to explore, especially since wandering around taking pictures and meeting quirky characters never stopped being fun. There are a few small design quirks, like the limited quest log space and how it’s tied to the bus pass, but nothing that seriously hurts the experience. The monochrome art style is a huge standout it’s rare to see it done this well, and it gives the game a cozy, storybook like atmosphere. The soundtrack complements each area beautifully, and the ability to choose your own tunes adds a nice personal touch. If you’re unsure because of the price to playtime ratio, I’d suggest waiting for a sale.

- Search-and-find gameplay
- Searching complexity reminded me a lighter version of Tunic's second half of the game
- Plot is very down-to-earth. A protagonist goes out and takes photos. That's mainly it, but the simplicity gives the game experience time for the player to take their time to explore and enjoy photography
- Loved the camera features such as zoom and the filtering styles
- Comedy was in my alley, light and refreshing
- Great game for young children to play too, as long as they have reading comprehension
- Detailed animation: favorites were the weather conditions and the water/snowflakes landing on the lenses, the street crossing scene, and the subtle hints to find the requested photo
- Includes post-game content
- Didn't observe motion sickness 

There was only one instance, when I wanted to screen-record, and my Steam Deck went kaputt and the screen went black, but the mousepad was returning a haptic response. Once I force restarted the game and hesitantly screen-recorded a different scene, it worked. I didn't record as often however. (the scene that crashed my Steam Deck was the one where the ghost was playing a shuffle cup and guessing game)

[h2][u]Overview[/u][/h2]
I’m a sucker for the task based “cozy” genre like [i]A Short Hike[/i]. Toem probably set the bar for this genre as my new favorite. It does everything right with solid game design choices and is just overall a pleasant experience that was perfect for unwinding at the end of the day.

[h2][u]Story[/u][/h2]
While I am a fan of the “Cozy” games, I desperately need some kind of drive to keep playing. Open-ended cozy games without a clear story to keep you moving and questing just feel aimless to me and I lose interest. Thankfully, Toem has no such problems and has a clear goal established from the very beginning. You’re on an adventure to tour a mystical sight, but it’s at the top of a mountain several towns away. Thus to fund this trip, you do quests for people to earn bus fare. You then take the bus to the next town and do more quests to earn more bus fare. Repeat until you make it to the final destination! It’s a simple premise and full of enough diverse locations, tasks, puzzles and cast of characters to keep it from getting stale. As a bonus, there was even a free DLC and a short vacation bonus story to play as an epilogue after you finish the base game.

[h2][u]Presentation[/u][/h2]
This game oozes style with its unique black and white presentation and music you can turn your brain off and hum along to. There are plenty of different locations to explore and each does a very good job capturing a different feeling. Each new biome has its own set of animals to find and snap pictures of, allowing the game to double as a collectathon – gotta snap them all! There is some customization where you can dress the main character up. Some of the dress up is required for the quests, but there’s plenty of optional clothes and accessories as well.

[h2][u]Gameplay[/u][/h2]
The game is highly integrated with the story – the game is essentially interacting with the world around you which feels very alive. As you take off from the bus stop you can ask to see how many stamps you require to go to the next area. Then off you go to talk with NPCs. As you help them out and complete tasks they’ll reward you with stamps and sometimes accessories/clothes or new gadgets or ways to progress through the area. 

The game is appealing to both completionists and casuals in its game design approach. You do not have to help every single NPC as there are far more tasks/stamps available than are required to proceed to the next area. But the number isn’t so overwhelming that you’d want to skip. Its really fun to try to 100% every area and do everything you possibly can. 

As you talk to NPCs your card will get updated with tasks for them. Sometimes you may be surprised and help them before you even realize it was a task. Other times it can be more complex or a bit harder to interpret what is meant to be done. But for the most part, the quests seemed to be at an engaging enough level to keep me interested but not so difficult that I ever wanted to skip any. At worst, there were a few times I felt kind of lost trying to hunt down very specific animals which were intended to be difficult to find in the first place. 

I played this game in the evenings before bed and it was a very relaxing experience and I never felt frustrated but wasn’t complete brain-off either.

[h2][u]Summary[/u][/h2]
Overall, Toem was such a delightful experience that I immediately had to send it to several of my friends. It’s cute, charming, and most importantly for a game—fun! It cured my life long depression even if only for a temporary 4 to 5 hours. But what a time that was. Honestly, I prefer shorter games as I am more likely to actually complete them. I think it was just the right length and didn’t ever feel close to overstaying its welcome. Super looking forward to the sequel.

Mechanically speaking TOEM is a rather simple game, you interact with the environment by either talking to people or looking at/taking pictures of people.

Despite the simple gameplay it works out just cause of the silly and fun writing, charming characters and little secrets you find here and there.

My favorite part is how diegetic the music system is, your character has a walkman and when listening to the soundtrack in the game you see little headphones on the character.

🎮 Genre: Adventure

📖 Review:

Some of these small games give me more chill and fun than big triple-A titles. This one is definitely a great indie game with creative mechanics and enjoyable gameplay. Most of the quests you work on are genuinely fun.
The graphics look very nice and unique. The story isn’t much, but it fits perfectly for this kind of game. Some of the sprites and world elements don’t scale properly in 4K resolution, but I didn’t really care during my playthrough.

Playtime: 4 hours (not 100% achievements)

👍 Pros:

Unique look
Good gameplay
Chill vibe
Creative game mechanics
Nice map design
In-game achievement progress monitor

👎 Cons:

Some sprites appear blurry in 4K resolution

🔥 Overall Impression:

TOEM is a nice and relaxing photo adventure game where you help people along the way. Don’t waste your time thinking just try this little gem. You won’t regret it!

The premise of TOEM is simple. You are a young kid who lives with their Nana, when you're pushed gently out of the door armed only with a camera and tasked with making the journey to see the titular TOEM. To do this you'll travel through a series of themed areas - a beach town, or a bustling city, for example - taking photos of unusual or interesting things, people, and events before getting to move on to the next one. 

What this results in is a beautifully tranquil experience. TOEM is a game about losing oneself in the world around you and enjoying the gentle movement of life. It's a magical feeling that few games seek to capture.",76561198048466706,0,37,241,0,241,2025-06-19T19:07:43+00:00

Toem is a cute and simple photography puzzle game. You walk around and explore rural and urban areas interacting with cool characters and creatures. People want to see your photos, or you take a photo and it changes the world around you. 

The mechanics and artstyle are extremely simple but super engaging. I love the 2D artstyle and was immediately blown away by the camera change from 3rd person top down to 1st person, while still keeping the world 2D. This game places a strong emphasis on perceptive, as it should as picture taking is its main mechanic. And it does it so impressively well. 

The longer I played this game the more I found it changing how I played. I started taking photos preemptively thinking ""someone will want to see this."" I started shifting the camera more to find all the little secrets or appreciate the personality the environment has. I'm a little photographer now, finding photos in both the unique and mundane, for other people at first, and then for myself. 

At the end of the game I found myself fondly flipping through my photo album. The pictures I took were funny, occasionally out of focus or of frame, and showcased the lovely little world the developers built. And isn't that so endearing that this game made me want to do that? 

There isn't much for story or dialogue but I don't think this game needed anymore than it currently has. In no way does Toem feel unfinished or incomplete. 

Toem does one thing and it does it so fantastically. With one trick indie games I often find myself exhausted when there's one mechanic in the game that it's clearly built around, since this often leads to a lack of diversity in gameplay. But since toem is only a few hours long and it's world is so fun, I didn't feel that here. 

Toem is a game that inspires warmth and joy and other pleasant feelings. With it's artstyle, fun gameplay, and calming soundtrack, I think everyone should try this out. 

I don't know if there's enough content to justify $20, but i would say it's easily at least worth $10.",76561198075640742,417,74,314,0,178,2025-08-12T11:52:57+00:00

[b]A Wholesome Snapshot of Calm and Curiosity[/b]

[i]TOEM[/i] is a delightful hand-drawn adventure that invites players to slow down, look around and appreciate the little things. It’s a game that isn’t about rushing or high scores — it’s about relaxing, exploring and discovering the world one photo at a time.

Armed with just your trusty camera, you set out on a journey through charming monochrome environments, helping quirky characters and solving light puzzles along the way. There’s no combat or pressure — just a cozy world full of charm and surprises waiting to be captured through your lens.

Exploration is the heart of [i]TOEM[/i]. There’s a lot of back-and-forth as you revisit areas with fresh eyes and new goals, and that loop of discovery is part of the joy. Whether it’s finding a hidden creature, solving a visual riddle, or just snapping the perfect picture, every task feels satisfying in its simplicity.

[i]TOEM[/i] is a gentle reminder that sometimes the best adventures are the quiet ones. It's about the journey, not the destination — and the pictures you take along the way.

[b]Rating: 8/10[/b]
A calm, clever and creative photo adventure that rewards curiosity and invites you to take your time. A true cozy gem.",76561198045144284,2330,46,350,0,350,2025-05-28T19:07:38+00:00

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[h1]Introduction[/h1]
TOEM from Scandinavian studio “Something We Made”, published in collaboration with “popagenda” and with some addition fiscal aid from “Humble Games”, is a simple, monochrome, photography-based puzzle game with some light comedy. The main game is split into four big areas and two small areas, as well as one quite substantial bonus area, which was added some time after the game’s release in a free update as a thank you from the developers due to the game’s sudden success.

[h1]Premise[/h1]
This great success? An overwhelmingly positive review score of 99% lifetimes positive reviews as of me writing this in December 2025. The game centers around an unnamed, lightly triangle-shaped and uncannily Moomin-resembling character, who is sent onto a grand, coming-of-age adventure by their photographer enthusiast grandmother (or “Nana”, as the game prefers to call her) to witness the legendary phenomenon at the peak of Kiiruberg mountain, the titular “TOEM”.

[h1]Review[/h1]
I learned of TOEM very late (I believe it was only early this year) and man is it better late than ever. All of the positive reception TOEM has received is well-deserved. The game takes its photography mechanics, and even stretches the defined bounds of photo-taking a little, to deliver a real masterclass in lively and endearing world design, with a really beautiful, relaxing soundtrack. Additional tracks may be unlocked as puzzle rewards, to either play at random or be chosen at will by opening the menu of the game’s in-world music device, the “Hikelady” (yes, a silly play on the Sony “Walkman”, which did make me chuckle more than it should’ve when it clicked). All locations are based around a “community stamp collection”, help the local community of any given location you’re in and they will reward you for your efforts with stamps. Collect enough stamps, and your bus fare to the next location is covered for free, by virtue of you being such a good sport to multiple communities throughout the game’s runtime. It’s a fantastic premise, and an honest-to-god utopian idea.

TOEM’s strength lies chiefly in the fact it rarely takes itself particularly seriously. It’s a photography game, sure, but you won’t be doing any hardcore photography, instead you’ll be capturing silly pictures of silly and sometimes mysterious things to complete your collection book of local fauna or to help out the local townsfolk with finding things they’ve lost, or even taking photographs of weird space anomalies to put a few magicked items to the state they ought to be in. No puzzles are particularly hard, but they will make you think and explore and pay attention to all of your surroundings in a beautiful way, that helps you appreciate everything around you, which is precisely what photography should achieve anyway, so the game captures the spirit of the premise perfectly there, even if in a roundabout way.

As for flaws? You might stumble upon the rare obscurely phrased puzzle, or even a puzzle that seems like it could mean multiple things: I, for instance, found myself particularly irked by one or two puzzles in “Logcity”, the game’s third big area. A lot of this can be forgiven, as it was literally two quests of like a hundred, and all of them are short enough throughout the game’s runtime to not outstay their welcome or sully your experience, and some handy guides are always there, made by a few helpful users here on Steam for example, which will help you out if you find yourself in the rare pickle. I have to fess up here, however, to the fact that I beat TOEM’s entire 6-7 hour campaign in one-sitting, so with healthier breaks and a more leisurely pace you’re likely to not run into these possibly fatigue-bolstered frustrations.

Lastly, even though the game doesn’t take itself too seriously, I would’ve loved some sharpness and depth of field options to really bring out certain objects in the foreground from the background in a more elegant way, which only goes double for a monochrome, low contrast world such as this one. The game does give you a few frames/stickers and filters to play around with, but they’re fairly primitive and go mostly unused in the puzzles, which is a shame. Also, for some reason, that I presume to be a stylistic choice, the characters and fauna in TOEM (basically anything that is living or moves in any significant way) is lower quality than the still life, which I find a little strange. I often found myself zooming onto characters in the world and seeing the pristine background behind them, while the light texturing and some lines seemed awkwardly blurry. Your eyes adjust rather swiftly to this weird phenomenon, but still, I can’t say it was a choice I particularly welcomed for a photography game.

[h1]Conclusion[/h1]
If you’ve never played and/or heard of TOEM, do me a favor and play it! Have you already played TOEM and have kids in your family, or even have some of your own? Show them TOEM. Despite its lack of color, the game’s general shapes, aesthetics, locales, as well as its humorous and adventurous vibes put me strongly in mind of Hilda by Luke Pearson, and I’d personally struggle to find higher praise for another whimsical, family-friendly piece of art than that.

I also wasn't very compelled to play it. I found myself starting it and kinda doom-scrolling on my phone when it got to be kinda convoluted. 
I'm still going to recommend it, only because I think that the reasons I don't like it are my fault and not the creators.

The fun part is NPCs usually don’t directly say what they want, instead, they speak in riddles like someone might ask for “bugs with little lamps” instead of saying fireflies. A trickier one might ask for “little soldiers” which turned out to be [spoiler]ants[/spoiler]. Others might be more for the good eyes like the Gangs looking for graffities, or that an old man asking for a snowfall he made as a kid, now turned out to be a [spoiler]huge snowball on a nearby island[/spoiler]. The game doesn’t automatically detect the right photo, so it’s up to you to figure it out and pick the correct picture to complete the request.

As progress, you unlock helpful tools including a trumpet to scare away seagulls or break ice, a water gun to pop balloons blocking paths, diving masks for going underwater, hiking boots for snowy hills and grabbing tools for ropes... These gadgets help you fully explore the map. The good news is you don’t need to finish every single quest to move forward to the next area.

There’s also a photo album collection to complete. The game encourages player to rotate camera angles to spot posters on walls or secret paths hidden from the default view. Sometimes you’ll find a treasure chest, other times it may help with a request.

Overall, this is a relaxing, easy, enjoyable game and totally see why it’s been well received. It took me about 4 hours to finish the main story and bonus content, but going for 100% would definitely take longer. Besides, it looks like the devs are still working on more updates, I’d like to check out the sequel or DLC.

I recommended this game, the best value is getting a Steam key.

I think it comes down to a few things: 

- The heartwarming hero's journey of the main character coming at a time in my life where I felt like I had to overcome insurmountable odds
- The addictive photograph mechanic that feels amazing to play around with
- The unique cast of funny characters, with animations that give them so much charm and personality
- The gameplay loop feeling so engaging to play through, solving puzzles and finding what needs to be found
- A visual style that is oooozing with substance, despite the lack of colour

I loved the combination of the visuals and the soundtrack!

The achievements in this game aren't difficult at all! A lot of them will come naturally as you just play through the game.

TOEM is a game that was completely out of the norm of what I usually played. I wasn't really sure what to expect when I initially started but I quickly started to enjoy the game. The visuals, soundtrack, and generally joyous vibe left me feeling good the whole way. There may not be a lot of gameplay depth, but there are fun challenges to complete tied to the achievements, and the in-game quests that make you think creatively and I can appreciate that.

Full completion will have you run around and look for stuff you've missed, but you can finish it earlier (hence kids could have a blast too - without too much frustration).
You can feel the love and thought that went into it in every little story you encounter. And sometimes you will hold on to a picture just because you enjoy it, not because you need it. The design is just such a blast to behold.
Big bonus: it can be played with a controller (didn't try it out though), keyboard + mouse or just mouse. So there's a wide range of options for accessibility, allowing almost anyone to play. I will be gifting it to someone who can only use one hand, knowing they will love the photography theme.

That's not to say that TOEM is a bad game at all however, quite the opposite, bringing forth a profoundly comforting experience that does just enough as to not feel totally mindless. The artstyle in particular stands out to me when considering the sort of game this is, pairing the goal of taking a lot of pictures of everything with a purely monochromatic palette, bringing more attention to noting all the weird little unexpected movements of your surroundings or even just, vaguely interesting shapes, which I found got me feeling even more intimately aware of the world.

This is made even more exciting and satisfying by the way a lot of the little jobs you get are laid out, being spread all across the different locations and often getting you to backtrack to take some pictures of cool things. However, the game ends up indirectly teaching you as a result to be paying especially close attention to anything that could strike you as even vaguely interesting. I feel like TOEM ends up striking this really interesting balance where you're taking pictures due to knowing that they'll probably be relevant later, yet it feels like you're just taking pictures for the intrinsic reward of getting to have your little character experience the world even moreso. It's a weird dynamic that I haven't really seen performed quite so well, and is a big part of why I think there's some seriously impressive and elegant design work that goes into this, giving that core gameplay some real teeth just through how magical the act of taking a photo ends up becoming.

The only real complaint I have here is that I do feel like some of the atmosphere of taking a journey further away from home gets lost due to the ease of backtracking. There are some moments of the game that really frame what you're doing as this grandiose, but slightly intimidating circumstance that constantly puts you into increasingly alienating situations as you're leaving that comfort of home, but they end up clashing a bit with the fact that home is just a bus stop away. I understand that for a game like this, it might've been thought of as too much to make the player commit to travelling to their next big location each time, but I also think that even making it that full fast travel being unlocked at the end of the game as a way to clean up anything you missed could be a good compromise as to lead to something a little more emotionally resonant, even if what's here now is still beautiful. Sometimes a short, 3 hour game packed with more charm than anything else is good for the soul, sometimes you've just gotta play something that makes you feel like you're cozily wrapped up in a blanket, and this fill that niche wonderfully.

In all seriousness, this is one of the sweetest little cozy games I've played in a while. If you like taking pictures, exploring areas, solving little puzzles, and achievement hunting -- this is the game for you!
You can feel how much fun the team behind this game had while making it, and the love put into it. The bonus content they added really seals the deal. Not only is this game adorable and fun aesthetically, the puzzles are fulfilling yet simple enough to figure out without frustration. The maps get a bit more complicated as you go on, but it adds to the fun feeling of adventure with every shift of tone and style.

It was also a game that made me stop every now and then and just soak up what each area had to offer. There's so much to just enjoy looking at. Basically, easter egg hunting the game.

the game is in black and white, so it's not cute in the conventional glowing pastel pink way, but it works beautifully.

i enjoyed wandering around so much i made sure to get all the achievements. it never felt repetitive, there are specific tasks, but you're also free to take pictures of whatever and save them to your album.

i was mostly vibing, but still very interested in finding out what a toem is.
the idea of walking around and capturing different places is lovely. the black and white art is different and unexpected in a good way

the soundtrack of this game is something beyond this world. the fisherman's song is forever stuck in my head.

it's quietly emotional, chill, cozy, wholesome. in the kind of way where you feel like you'd totally walk around and take pictures of everything too, while your goal is to experience something greater but the journey is even more special than the thing you're pursuing. toem is a gentle reminder to appeciate the small things along the way.

the photo mechanic is natural and free, however, and thankfully, there's a checklist you need to complete. i feel like free roaming wouldn't be the type of thing i'd enjoy, so having a clear task list is helpful and guiding. and the game does that without ever being stressful.

toem is for people who just want to chill and take pictures of frogs and ghosts, and appreciate the world around them without stressing too much about it.",76561199497381406,33,49,471,0,471,2024-12-22T00:06:42+00:00

I was able to 100% it in under 10 hours (including Basto), so don't go into this expecting a long experience. Additionally, there isn't a lot of replay value. Once you've finished everything, that's it. You can of course go back and enjoy the cute world the game offers, taking additional photos to add to your album, but there isn't any actual content worth replaying.

All of that being said, this is an amazing little game. It's fun, lighthearted, and adorable. The mechanics are fun, the puzzles clever, and the world is just plain enjoyable to explore and interact with. At no point did I find any facet of the game to be dull or boring, no activity was tedious. Everything was the perfect length to not wear out its welcome. For the full $20 price tag, I think this is worth it for a day's entertainment. Even better if it's discounted.

A few quirks and notes to be mindful of:
- Some of the quests can't be completed until you visit other areas. Don't get stuck in one area trying to complete everything because you probably can't.
- There were a very few instances where it wasn't clear what you were supposed to do. Everything revolves around your camera, so just keep trying different things until you figure it out
- Be sure to utilize the rotating game camera. There are hidden things everywhere that can only be seen if you're looking at things from the right angle
- Also be sure to utilize the first person perspective with the in-game camera. There are some things hidden outside of the wide view that can only be spotted this way.
- Don't be stingy with pictures. You have a ton of album space and won't come close to running out even after doing all the in-game quests. 

Did I really love this game? Absolutely. Am I going to put it away for a while and revisit it down the road? You better believe it. Is TOEM for everyone? Probably not, but if you're a fan of this kind of fun, quirky, cute game, I highly recommend it.",76561198100654431,0,9,434,0,434,2025-06-28T04:08:39+00:00

There's so much you can do with the camera, and you're constantly encouraged to notice/observe,experiment. It turns every interaction into a small moment of discovery and rewards curiosity in the gentlest way. I loved trying new things and guessing which would give me achievements lol

And the characters ?? wow.....it honestly boggles my mind how each one has their own quirks and fits so naturally with their environment. Every encounter made me smile :) The soundtrack is another standout, the music added so much soul to the journey !! Thank you for making me discover Launchable Socks!

TOEM doesn't have much of a story except for the overarching quest to witness/see TOEM, though it is never really explained what that is or means. This didn't subtract from the experience or fun at all - it's just not what the game is going for. I would say it does have a wholesome narrative through your actions, but not really a story.

The gameplay mainly consists of characters within a level requesting that you capture photos of various things; sometimes the requests are straightforward, other times more abstract. The puzzle is usually either finding out where the photo subject is or figuring out what the abstract request is referring to. It was fun to explore each level, trying to keep an eye out for things that might fit the photo criteria. You sort of build a repository in the back of your mind of things you need to look out for, which I found fun. I found each quest to be unique and interesting, never getting repetitive despite the simple concept.

The art style is very cute and well-done, as you can probably tell from the store page.

For the achievement hunters, this game's achievements are very manageable. No B.S. whatsoever, no missables, just completionist quests and some easter egg-ish ones. I could get 95% of them without a guide as I played. No need for a replay.

To add on to that, the dialogue for the NPCs populating each of the areas manages to be both fun and make the world seem more alive.

The only thing I disliked about the game is that some of the puzzles are a bit too cryptic, with characters asking for pictures via very vague descriptions and not giving any really useful hints or guidance, although that's more of a personal frustration and even then, there's a myriad of walkthroughs online.

One of the best parts of TOEM is how unhurried it feels. The game encourages you to take your time and notice the little details, and the photo mechanic, while basic, is fun to use. Each area you visit has its own feel, with small side quests that are often clever. The music adds to the cozy mood.

However the gameplay can get repetitive since most tasks boil down to “find this thing, take a photo, return it”. The camera controls can also feel a bit awkward, and the game’s overall length is on the short side but that might be a good thing since it doesn't overstay its welcome.

I thoroughly enjoyed this game and am looking forward to Toem 2. It is simple, but effective. The gameplay mechanics are straightforward, but the puzzles are fun and challenging. The story isn't life changing, but it gives you something to appreciate. Good performance on linux.

Gameplay:
The gameplay primarily consists of using a camera to take pictures and help people complete tasks. The camera has a few  simple add-ons that help you progress through the story or just give you extra room to express your photos. There are times where further story progression or out-of-the-box thinking is required, but I won't say more than that.

Controls/Graphics:
I used an 8bitdo controller and steam deck controller for this game and didn't have any problems. At one point, I did need to type something with my keyboard, but it wasn't bad.
Graphics are basic, but the art style is fun. You can probably run the game on maximum settings on most of systems.

Devices played on:
PC - EndeavourOS (Arch) w/ nvidia GPU
Steam Deck OLED

Bugs:
PC - game looked like there were two things overlayed on top of one-another and wouldn't respond to controller (hard to describe). Switched to Proton Experimental. No issues afterwards.
Steam Deck - resolution was set incorrectly on first run. Was able to switch to native resolution in settings. No issues afterwards.",76561198811532599,0,11,377,0,377,2025-04-18T04:35:54+00:00

I can't describe how much I love this game. I've played a few indie titles at this point, and TOEM is definitely one of the best ones out there. It's silly, quirky, funny, adorable, and the gameplay is so very fun. I love being able to point the camera at anything and just snap pictures, fill the compendium, and solve the puzzles laid out before me!
Everything in this game is so relaxed and laid-back, so feel free to take it at your own pace. Listen to the music. Be in awe of the various landscapes.

Taking pictures is really easy, just press Y on your gamepad, aim and press right trigger. Nice, decent music in each scene.
The graphics are simple, but really adequate to carry over the charm of an urban photo safari. You can play it chapter by chapter, with each chapter taking like an hour or so if you do the bare minimum, and a little more time if you prefer a perfect score. 

Buy this game if you are between 6 and 112 years old and are looking for something to calm down after a stressful day at school, work or nursing home.

This is an excellent little game! I am someone who typically doesn't play cozy games, because the one's I've tried didn't hold my attention. But for whatever reason, Toem not only held my attention, but provided me with an adorable, heartwarming experience that I absolutely loved.

Pros:
* The artstyle is incredible. The black and white cartoon look is something I couldn't get enough of. I was afraid it would get hard on the eyes, and it really never did. The game also reminds you periodically to take breaks, in a very clean, non-intrusive way.
* The sound design is perfect. The music is very chill, and there are in-game mechanics/reasons for you to change the music if you have a particular track you prefer. Every little interaction is satisfying, mostly due the great sound design.
* The cute factor is through the roof. It's one of those games that has you smiling the entire time. There's also a lot of humor sprinkled throughout, which I appreciated.
* The mechanics and UI are simple, but in the best way. They do a lot with very little here; it's not a mechanically rich game by any means, but the mechanics they use keep game play fresh and interesting.  Mild spoilers -- using the stamp book as a way to lock levels off until you've progressed is a fantastic mechanic with an in-game explanation as to why you can't progress. I also loved the different costumes you could collect; it's such a small thing, but I loved it. Especially the shoes, because different shoes have different walk sound effects. 

Cons:
* The game crashed once, after I'd finished it and someone else started a new game. Outside of that, I can't think of anything that was negative.

This game is just fun; it looks good, sounds good, plays good, and is cute and cozy on top of all that. I can't recommend Toem enough to cozy game enthusiasts -- and even if you dislike cozy games, maybe try this one.",76561198981670585,0,25,456,0,456,2025-04-05T06:16:49+00:00

TOEM is a cute puzzle photography game that requires an element of creativity and problem solving to complete your objectives. The difficulty of these objectives can vary...sometimes it's as simple as just taking a picture of something, and other times you'll need to apply a certain effect or position to a photo in order to complete the quest.

The gameplay overall is really solid and I feel that the photo component alone is a really fun and fresh feature to explore.

The world is a whole other beast and I LOVE IT! It's super cute and the cast of characters they have littered through this game are very fun to interact with.

I recommend this if you are looking for a : Cosy game, adventure game, photographing, relaxing and casual game, 6-8 hours game to play, and if you are not bothered with the black and white graphic the entire game. 

I really enjoy this, this was recommended to me by many, and I hadn't gotten round to it until now, and now I can understand why the cosy gamers are very excited for TOEM 2, I too, join in with the excitement for TOEM 2!",76561199242413726,194,46,447,0,447,2025-03-24T16:55:01+00:00

A charming light puzzler that feels creative and never too frustrating. 

[h1]What I Liked[/h1]
The black and white cartoon graphics and ambient sound style were relaxing. I used a guide for the first map, but quickly realized the puzzles wee fairly easy and (more fun) to figure out organically.

The photograph mechanic is the games main interaction for solving most puzzles, and this works fairly well. it's fun to edit and frame a photo you took in game. 

[h1]What Could Be Improved[/h1]
The game is maybe a little too easy. Some of the puzzles' solutions were right in the open. This is mostly a strength as the game felt relaxing to complete, but I feel some additional challenge would have been welcome.

[h1]Final Thoughts & Rating[/h1]
A unique collect-a-thon puzzler with a fresh art style that doesn't overstay it's welcome. Recc. for unwinding after a long day when you don't want to have too much stress.

While their gameplay differs (photography vs. creating objects with a magical notepad), both games have you help people by collecting stars in thematically-distinct regions and seem primarily aimed at younger audiences. They also have a similar art style.

Now, apologies for what will be a spoiler-heavy review, but humor me, as Toem has left me ruminating on its color palette.

[spoiler]For almost the entire game I wished there was a bit of color. I found that the lack of color hurt the game's visual appeal and wondered if the devs just made that choice to lighten their artists' workloads a bit. However, after finally seeing toem at the end, I realized I couldn't have been more wrong. I didn't even realize right away why toem was so darned beautiful and impactful, but suddenly it dawned on me that the beautiful aurora was the first time that the player ever sees color.

This could be reading into things too much, but I took ""seeing toem"" as a metaphor for having a change in perspective on life. Our character travels far and wide to realize that the world we once found gray and lifeless was actually full of color. The preceding hours of seeing wholesome and beautiful things in monochrome really set up that point, so I think the color scheme choice was critical in letting the ending have the impact it did.

You start the game sitting on your bed in your room in a totally gray world looking at flowers through a TV screen. When you walk into the next room, the first thing Nana says to you is ""Look who made it out of their room"", as if you had been spending a lot of time in there lately, and venturing out at all was a big step for you. That's what allows for the ""the day you've dreamed about"", of seeing toem, to finally come; it's a return to life, or at least the start of one, brought about by literally seeing the world from a different perspective through your camera, which stands in for a shift in emotional perspective. There's a reason that Nana doesn't want you to try to experience it through her photo album; it's a lesson that is best learned yourself, and she realizes the day has come that you're ready for it.

I was curious about the meaning of toem, and an online dictionary informed me that töm (i.e. toem) means ""to empty"" in the devs' native Swedish. You could therefore interpret ""experiencing toem"" as ""experiencing nothingness"", or leaving behind the self and having an encounter with the sublime at the top of the (likely metaphorical) mountain. This would point to having a profound and transformative emotional experience while viewing yourself from an outside perspective.[/spoiler]

Other pros:
* Lovely music. A couple of the tracks were downright special.
* Cute and wholesome. [spoiler]I love the guitar wizard :)[/spoiler]
* Decently fun gameplay loop. The photo compendium might be the closest I've been to the trick book from SSX Tricky since I was a kid.
* The game isn't voice acted, but the dialogue still gives the impression of being in Swedish, which I found interesting and fit with the setting and developers. Always fun when games unintentionally leave me thinking about linguistics.
* Some nice attention to detail, like [spoiler]setting a trend with your hat in the fashion show and encountering people around town wearing your hat afterwards.[/spoiler]
* Some cool and unexpected moments [spoiler], like the moose DJ area and the cosmic deer.[/spoiler]
* You can pet most of the animals.

Cons:
* Nearby objects looked blurry through the camera even without zooming.
* I found the menus to be a bit clunky to navigate. For example, if you access the quick select menu via the X button, you have to be holding the d-pad arrow when you let go of X to get the selected item to actually to open.

Grab your camera and go on an epic adventure to the top of the mountain while you visit multiple photogenic locations! Help others with their errands and other requests while filling your camera roll with the memories you make along this journey. 

Toem is a very chill game about completing a bunch of quests by taking pictures and running errands in exchange for items and stamps. You need to get a certain amount of stamps per region before you get your free bus ticket to the next area. It’s a fun way to make sure you interact with most of the area before moving onto a new one without making it feel forced. 

What I love most about Toem is that is has compendium for all of the animals in the game. It’s so fun collecting a picture of every species in each region, especially in the free content update area (Basto) because it works with a day-night cycle. You really need to look around during both day and night to find all of the creatures and I think it adds just the right amount of spice. 

I completed the whole game in one day, over the span of 5 hours. Toem sucked me in so much that I didn’t even notice a whole 5 hours had gone by! The characters have funny dialogue, the quests are very fun to complete, the art and sound tracks are lovely, and the whole game experience is just wonderful. I’m so glad I picked this game up. Can’t wait for the sequel!

From the moment you step into its monochrome, hand-drawn world, the game invites you to slow down, observe, and appreciate the small details hidden throughout its whimsical environments. Rather than relying on fast-paced action or complex mechanics, TOEM leans into a simple yet deeply engaging core loop: using your camera to capture the world around you and solve creatively designed puzzles.

The story is lighthearted and minimal, centered around a young photographer on a journey to uncover the mysteries of the enigmatic TOEM. This narrative serves mostly as a gentle guide, encouraging players to explore diverse regions filled with quirky characters and charming scenarios. Each area introduces new challenges that require you to think outside the box, often tasking you with photographing particular objects, animals, or events in order to progress. The puzzles are never overly difficult, making TOEM accessible to players of all ages and skill levels, but they are clever enough to keep you engaged and eager to see what each new location has to offer.

Visually, TOEM stands out with its distinctive hand-drawn art style that conveys warmth and personality despite its limited color palette. The use of monochrome tones not only gives the game a unique aesthetic but also enhances the meditative and tranquil mood that permeates the entire experience. Each environment is thoughtfully crafted, brimming with subtle animations and little touches that reward careful observation. Complementing the visuals is a soothing soundtrack that perfectly captures the game’s relaxing vibe, drawing players into a world where exploration feels effortless and delightful.

The gameplay centers entirely on photography, which serves as both your tool and objective. Whether it’s snapping a picture of a rare bird, a clever environmental detail, or an amusing scene unfolding in front of you, the camera mechanic is intuitive and satisfying to use. This focus on capturing moments encourages players to slow down and engage more deeply with the game’s world, making TOEM feel less like a traditional game and more like an interactive, playful journey. The branching tasks and side quests provide enough variety to keep the gameplay fresh, while the absence of timers or penalties allows for a stress-free experience.

TOEM also excels in its accessibility and technical polish. The controls are simple and user-friendly, ensuring that players new to gaming or unfamiliar with the genre can easily pick it up and enjoy. Its smooth performance across multiple platforms, including PC, Nintendo Switch, and PlayStation 5, reflects the developer’s attention to delivering a seamless experience regardless of hardware. Notably, the game runs exceptionally well on the Steam Deck, which adds portability and convenience for players who want to enjoy it on the go.

Critical reception of TOEM has been overwhelmingly positive, with many players praising its calming atmosphere, creative puzzle design, and heartfelt worldbuilding. It has been lauded as a perfect title for those seeking a break from fast-paced or stressful games, offering instead a gentle escape filled with moments of quiet joy. While the game’s relatively short length—usually completed within 4 to 6 hours—may leave some wanting more, its focused design ensures that every minute feels meaningful and well-crafted.

In summary, TOEM: A Photo Adventure is a beautiful and original indie title that combines artistic vision, inventive gameplay, and a peaceful ambiance to create a truly memorable experience. Its emphasis on photography and exploration makes it stand apart from typical adventure games, providing a refreshing change of pace. Whether you’re a casual player looking for a relaxing journey or a fan of unique narrative-driven games, TOEM offers a captivating and heartwarming adventure that lingers long after you’ve put the camera down.
