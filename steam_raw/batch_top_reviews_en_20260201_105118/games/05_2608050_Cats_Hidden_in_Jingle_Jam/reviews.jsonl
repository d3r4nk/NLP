Perfect for players looking for a light, casual experience without much pressure.\n\nHowever, the soundtrack remains an issue I had already noticed: the music tends to feel repetitive, and since it accompanies you throughout the entire gameplay, a bit more variety would have helped make the atmosphere feel fresher and more engaging.\n\nOne thing I particularly enjoyed — though it might not be for everyone — is the massive number of achievements you unlock simply by finding each little cat.\nPersonally, I found it quite satisfying, but I can see how some players might feel that it disrupts the game's relaxing flow.\n\nCats hidden in Jingle Jam: I really enjoyed stumbling upon animated objects and colorful interactions just by playing around with the environment. The first map was way too easy — I finished it in about two minutes (and I probably could’ve done it even faster if I’d been focused).\n\nThe second map, on the other hand, was much more challenging. Even though it was small, I had to use some hints because I just couldn’t find a few of the cats. Honestly, if you could spot those right away, you might want to get your head checked — they were that well hidden.\n\nOverall, considering it’s free, it’s a light and fun experience, probably aimed at newcomers to the Cats Hidden series. It doesn’t have the depth of the other entries, but as a quick intro or short casual game, it does the job.\n\nIn conclusion, I wouldn’t discourage anyone from trying out these earlier chapters: they still offer a pleasant experience, especially for those looking for something quick and easy.\nThat said, unlike Around the World, don’t expect to spend much more than 30 minutes playing — you might end up finishing the game before you even realize it.", "author_steamid": "76561199573005532", "author_num_games_owned": 588, "author_num_reviews": 124, "author_playtime_forever": 17, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 17, "author_last_played": "2025-06-23T21:06:48+00:00"}

It's not just a game, it's a life-changing experience. It's a game that brought joy, peace, and love back into my marriage.\n\nMy wife and I have been married for 10 years, but we were going through a rough patch. We had grown apart, we barely talked, we argued a lot, and we had lost the spark that we once had. We were on the verge of divorce, and we didn't know how to fix it.\n\nThen, one day, I stumbled upon this game on Steam. It was free, it looked cute, and it was made for a charity event. I thought, why not give it a try? Maybe it would cheer me up a bit. I downloaded it and started playing.\n\nI was immediately hooked. The game was so relaxing, so charming, so fun. I loved finding and discovering the 100 cats hidden around the festive holiday village. I loved the hand-drawn artwork, the chill soundtrack, the easter eggs, and the achievements. I felt like a kid again, exploring a magical world full of wonder and surprises.\n\nBut the best part was, I wasn't alone. My wife noticed me playing the game, and she was curious. She asked me what it was, and I told her. She decided to join me, and we started playing together. We took turns finding the cats, we helped each other with the hints, we laughed at the funny animations, we competed for the timer mode, and we celebrated every achievement.\n\nWe had so much fun, we forgot about our problems. We rediscovered our common interests, our sense of humor, our teamwork, and our affection. We started talking again, listening again, understanding again, and loving again. We realized that we still had a lot in common, and that we still cared for each other.\n\nWe played the game every day, until we found all the cats and unlocked all the achievements. We even bought the DLC and the other games from the Travellin Cats franchise. We became fans of the developer and the artist, and we followed them on social media. We also donated to the Jingle Jam charity event, and we felt good about supporting a great cause.\n\nBut most importantly, we saved our marriage. We decided to give it another chance, and to work on our issues. We went to counseling, we communicated better, we compromised more, and we appreciated more. We rekindled the flame that we once had, and we fell in love all over again.\n\nAll thanks to this game. Cats Hidden in Jingle Jam is not just a game, it's a miracle. It's a game that saved my marriage, and my happiness. It's a game that I will always cherish, and always recommend. It's a game that everyone should play, especially with their loved ones.\n\nIf you haven't played it yet, do yourself a favor and play it now. You won't regret it. Trust me, it will change your life for the better. It did for me, and it can for you too.\n\nThank you, Travellin Cats, for making this game. Thank you, Nina-Serena, for creating this art. Thank you, The Yogscast, for hosting this event.

The objective of the game is to find one hundred cats hidden in each of two lovingly hand-drawn images. The game is very short, taking only thirty to forty minutes to complete, after which the time trial feature is unlocked for future playthroughs. While the time trial feature adds some replayability, the position of the cats do not change in future playthroughs which turns the game into a memory game.\n\nCompared to [i]Cats Hidden in Paris[/i], [i]Cats Hidden in Jingle Jam[/i] has a variety of improvements to the graphic and sound design. There are a number of hidden, interactive elements across the two levels/maps that add to the charming atmosphere with cute animations and colours. Though there is only one soundtrack, it is pleasant to listen to and, more importantly, it now plays during the game, not just the menu! Each cat in the level/map produces a unique (as far as I can tell) '[i]meow[/i]' sound when clicked on and has an associated achievement which shows its name and number.\n\nUnrelated to this review, the developer(s) requested feedback on the closing screen which I will provide as follows: Firstly, I think players should have a choice between listening to the music or to the ticking timer during the time trial mode. Secondly, I think it would be nice to give players the choice of having a timer during the first playthrough as well as some players may enjoy such a challenge. Finally, thanks for making this game free!", "author_steamid": "76561198034653472", "author_num_games_owned": 147, "author_num_reviews": 35, "author_playtime_forever": 27, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 27, "author_last_played": "2024-12-19T18:04:24+00:00"}

This game has a hint/reset button, a festive soundtrack with different sound effects, a save feature, hidden secrets in the environment, animation elements, 100 achievements, and 100 cats.\nIt's a very short game as it took me only 3 minutes to finish it and get all the achievements (all the achievements can be acquired in one sitting). It has only one ending and there is a save feature, so you can restart or continue the game from the moment you left off. I would rate its difficulty as 1/10 since the gameplay is minimal, there's a hint button available for unlimited use, and the instructions remain clear throughout the entire game (you need to find and right-click on each cat).\nTravellin Cats, in collaboration with The Yogscast, presents \"Cats Hidden in Jingle Jam\" - a free Christmas-themed hidden object game that includes all necessary controls (turning music/sounds on/off, zoom in/out, a hint button, and a reset button), along with some hidden surprises. The goal of the game is to click on every single cat hidden in the picture and this may sound easy, but in game it can be very challenging due to the cats having different kind of shapes and dimensions. The control system is good, and the game's difficulty is well-balanced. After finding all the hidden cats, you will also unlock the \"Timer Mode\" with a leaderboard where you can set and beat your own score (my personal best is 02:13:65). \nAll things considered, I would definitely recommend this game to casual players of all ages who want to test their observation skills or who like hidden object games with cats. 😺\nIf you can't find the last cat then you can watch my full game playthrough here:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WtkcDuwf0g&ab_channel=Spartakus\nP.S. If you like this kind of games then I would also recommend you the \"I commissioned some bees/dogs/cats\" series. Check it out on Steam.\nP.P.S.
