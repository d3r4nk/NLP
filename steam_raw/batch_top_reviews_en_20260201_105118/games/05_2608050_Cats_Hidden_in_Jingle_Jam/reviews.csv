[h3] What To Expect? [/h3]
It's a hidden object game in which you'll have to find a hundred hidden cats in a festive themed level. There's also an extra level in which you can find a hundred more cats. Expect a few minutes of gameplay.

[h3] Visuals, Audio and Performance [/h3]
It's a simple hand-drawn Hidden Object game with festive attributes. For audio, it has cheerful music playing. For performance, it should run on any computer and I didn't run into bugs.

Overall, while these games offer much shorter experiences — each chapter usually consisting of just one or two maps — I found it particularly enjoyable how interactive the environments were.
In these episodes, it’s fun to click on various background elements and see them react with sounds, animations, or color changes — a charming detail that seemed less present in the latest chapter.

In terms of difficulty, the earlier games are noticeably easier: a more relaxed and laid-back experience, more in line with what I initially expected from Around the World. Perfect for players looking for a light, casual experience without much pressure.

However, the soundtrack remains an issue I had already noticed: the music tends to feel repetitive, and since it accompanies you throughout the entire gameplay, a bit more variety would have helped make the atmosphere feel fresher and more engaging.

One thing I particularly enjoyed — though it might not be for everyone — is the massive number of achievements you unlock simply by finding each little cat.
Personally, I found it quite satisfying, but I can see how some players might feel that it disrupts the game's relaxing flow.

Cats hidden in Jingle Jam: I really enjoyed stumbling upon animated objects and colorful interactions just by playing around with the environment. The first map was way too easy — I finished it in about two minutes (and I probably could’ve done it even faster if I’d been focused).

The second map, on the other hand, was much more challenging. Even though it was small, I had to use some hints because I just couldn’t find a few of the cats. Honestly, if you could spot those right away, you might want to get your head checked — they were that well hidden.

Overall, considering it’s free, it’s a light and fun experience, probably aimed at newcomers to the Cats Hidden series. It doesn’t have the depth of the other entries, but as a quick intro or short casual game, it does the job.

In conclusion, I wouldn’t discourage anyone from trying out these earlier chapters: they still offer a pleasant experience, especially for those looking for something quick and easy.
That said, unlike Around the World, don’t expect to spend much more than 30 minutes playing — you might end up finishing the game before you even realize it.",76561199573005532,588,124,17,0,17,2025-06-23T21:06:48+00:00

The game features really lacklustre 2D visuals (does the developer not know 3D graphics became mainstream in the mid-1990s?).  Gamers don't spend thousands of dollars on gaming rigs and the latest 3D graphics cards to play 2D games.  Even mobile phones and game consoles can do 3D graphics now.  There's no excuse.

This is only free in a rudimentary sense... the developer has their hand out for a $5 USD ""donation"" for this as you were expected to buy the soundtrack from Steam... digital panhandling.  Like the homeless guys who splash dirty water on your windscreen at the traffic lights.  No thanks.

Bearing in mind that free games don't add +1 to your game collector count, should you bother adding this to your library and downloading it?

It's not just a game, it's a life-changing experience. It's a game that brought joy, peace, and love back into my marriage.

My wife and I have been married for 10 years, but we were going through a rough patch. We had grown apart, we barely talked, we argued a lot, and we had lost the spark that we once had. We were on the verge of divorce, and we didn't know how to fix it.

Then, one day, I stumbled upon this game on Steam. It was free, it looked cute, and it was made for a charity event. I thought, why not give it a try? Maybe it would cheer me up a bit. I downloaded it and started playing.

I was immediately hooked. The game was so relaxing, so charming, so fun. I loved finding and discovering the 100 cats hidden around the festive holiday village. I loved the hand-drawn artwork, the chill soundtrack, the easter eggs, and the achievements. I felt like a kid again, exploring a magical world full of wonder and surprises.

But the best part was, I wasn't alone. My wife noticed me playing the game, and she was curious. She asked me what it was, and I told her. She decided to join me, and we started playing together. We took turns finding the cats, we helped each other with the hints, we laughed at the funny animations, we competed for the timer mode, and we celebrated every achievement.

We had so much fun, we forgot about our problems. We rediscovered our common interests, our sense of humor, our teamwork, and our affection. We started talking again, listening again, understanding again, and loving again. We realized that we still had a lot in common, and that we still cared for each other.

We played the game every day, until we found all the cats and unlocked all the achievements. We even bought the DLC and the other games from the Travellin Cats franchise. We became fans of the developer and the artist, and we followed them on social media. We also donated to the Jingle Jam charity event, and we felt good about supporting a great cause.

But most importantly, we saved our marriage. We decided to give it another chance, and to work on our issues. We went to counseling, we communicated better, we compromised more, and we appreciated more. We rekindled the flame that we once had, and we fell in love all over again.

All thanks to this game. Cats Hidden in Jingle Jam is not just a game, it's a miracle. It's a game that saved my marriage, and my happiness. It's a game that I will always cherish, and always recommend. It's a game that everyone should play, especially with their loved ones.

If you haven't played it yet, do yourself a favor and play it now. You won't regret it. Trust me, it will change your life for the better. It did for me, and it can for you too.

Thank you, Travellin Cats, for making this game. Thank you, Nina-Serena, for creating this art. Thank you, The Yogscast, for hosting this event. Thank you, Cats Hidden in Jingle Jam, for saving my marriage.",76561199092782709,0,1,23,0,21,2024-03-26T15:12:23+00:00

The main objective is to find cats.  You are presented with a large hand-drawn Christmas themed screen.  Zoom in or you'll never find some of the cats because size varies.  Each time you click on a cat it meows.  And there are different meows, not just one.  Also a name pops up as an achievement.  

Music is the same as in all their games.  I really wish they would at least vary the tone a little because it's getting old after having  many of their games.

This game is a hidden object game. Or rather, a hidden cat game!

You search for 100 cats in a hand drawn black and white illustration.
The game is very simple and it will only cost you like 5 minutes of your time.
It's great to play with your kids and introduce them to videogames.

The cats meow when you find them. And there are some pretty funny meows in there!

But also great for achievement hunters!
Each cat you find is an achievement. There's no easier way to get those stats up!

[h1]Overview[/h1]
Created in collaboration with Yogscast for their Jingle Jam charity event, [i]Cats Hidden in Jingle Jam[/i] is a delightful, hand-drawn hidden object game in which your goal is to find 100 cats in a festive holiday village. Although the game only includes 1 level, it is so unexpectedly charming with its cute, hand-drawn graphics, cheerful music, and surprises/secrets that even Scrooge or The Grinch would be unable to resist its charm and would find themselves enamored with it.

[h1]Pros[/h1]
• Cute, hand-drawn graphics accompanied by wonderfully festive & whimsical music.
• Each cat meows in its own unique voice/sound when clicked/found; some of which are quite comical.
• Clicking on certain “non-cat” objects produces (unexpected but welcomed) sound effects (i.e., [spoiler]clinking the mug in the center of the map, or clicking the bells on the market stalls to make them jingle[/spoiler]) or animations (i.e., [spoiler]briefly animated snowmen[/spoiler]).
• Counter at the bottom of the screen indicates how many hidden cats remain.
• Hints available (if needed) when only 6 hidden cats remain.

[h1]Cons[/h1]
• Leaderboard (for optional timed rounds) is personal; no global or “friends only” leaderboards.

The objective of the game is to find one hundred cats hidden in each of two lovingly hand-drawn images. The game is very short, taking only thirty to forty minutes to complete, after which the time trial feature is unlocked for future playthroughs. While the time trial feature adds some replayability, the position of the cats do not change in future playthroughs which turns the game into a memory game.

Compared to [i]Cats Hidden in Paris[/i], [i]Cats Hidden in Jingle Jam[/i] has a variety of improvements to the graphic and sound design. There are a number of hidden, interactive elements across the two levels/maps that add to the charming atmosphere with cute animations and colours. Though there is only one soundtrack, it is pleasant to listen to and, more importantly, it now plays during the game, not just the menu! Each cat in the level/map produces a unique (as far as I can tell) '[i]meow[/i]' sound when clicked on and has an associated achievement which shows its name and number.

Unrelated to this review, the developer(s) requested feedback on the closing screen which I will provide as follows: Firstly, I think players should have a choice between listening to the music or to the ticking timer during the time trial mode. Secondly, I think it would be nice to give players the choice of having a timer during the first playthrough as well as some players may enjoy such a challenge.

Relaxing and funny game where you just need to find 100 hidden cats. Once you find them all, you just completed the whole game. Sounds easy right? Some cats are really tough to find but you will figure it out. If you can´t find some of them there is hint system that will help you. Art and music fits together nicely. In case you are still missing some cats, just take a look at my guide. :)

Overall it is a good game to decompress. If you have good eyes for seeking it will take you about 30 minutes to 1 hour at maximum. Also you will get easily those achievements. GL & HF.",76561198340135818,256,278,39,0,39,2025-03-28T21:25:02+00:00

The premise is simple: find all the cats hidden in festive scenes full of charming details. From adorable costumed kittens to decorations sparkling Christmas decorations, the game offers a visually appealing experience that is sure to delight feline and Christmas lovers.

However, despite its initial charm, the game has some limitations that may affect the player's experience in the long run. The lack of variety in the scenes and the absence of additional challenges beyond finding cats can make the gameplay become monotonous after a while. Additionally, the lack of customization options or alternative game modes could limit its appeal to those looking for a more diverse and lengthy experience.

In short, ""Cats Hidden in Jingle Jam"" is a fun and endearing proposal to enjoy during the Christmas season, especially for lovers of cats and the search for hidden objects. However, its lack of depth and variety may leave some players wanting more after a while.

I loved that each cat had a name, and each had a different meow! How much work must that have been!

Has a nice feature of zooming, which allowed me to find the last couple of cats.

The music was very charming.

This game has a hint/reset button, a festive soundtrack with different sound effects, a save feature, hidden secrets in the environment, animation elements, 100 achievements, and 100 cats.
It's a very short game as it took me only 3 minutes to finish it and get all the achievements (all the achievements can be acquired in one sitting). It has only one ending and there is a save feature, so you can restart or continue the game from the moment you left off. I would rate its difficulty as 1/10 since the gameplay is minimal, there's a hint button available for unlimited use, and the instructions remain clear throughout the entire game (you need to find and right-click on each cat).
Travellin Cats, in collaboration with The Yogscast, presents ""Cats Hidden in Jingle Jam"" - a free Christmas-themed hidden object game that includes all necessary controls (turning music/sounds on/off, zoom in/out, a hint button, and a reset button), along with some hidden surprises. The goal of the game is to click on every single cat hidden in the picture and this may sound easy, but in game it can be very challenging due to the cats having different kind of shapes and dimensions. The control system is good, and the game's difficulty is well-balanced. After finding all the hidden cats, you will also unlock the ""Timer Mode"" with a leaderboard where you can set and beat your own score (my personal best is 02:13:65). 
All things considered, I would definitely recommend this game to casual players of all ages who want to test their observation skills or who like hidden object games with cats. 😺
If you can't find the last cat then you can watch my full game playthrough here:
