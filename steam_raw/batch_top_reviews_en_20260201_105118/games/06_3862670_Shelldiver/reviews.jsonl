This game is without a doubt the most well-designed resource management game i've played. Because it simply nails a lot of secret formulas that other games tried to replicate for so long but some of them failed miserably. And then the art style, the smooth animations and sound design is the casing that makes it so delightful. That's what makes Shelldiver so special and SO... SOOO addicting. I finished the game in 5 hours in one sitting but I could've finished it in 3 if I wanted to do so. But I just wanted to extend my playthrough as much as I could, thats how fun it was.\n\nSo, what gameplay element am I talking about when I say that \"this game nailed but other idlers couldn't\"?\n\nProgresion. Normally in any idler game, resources feel like you start the game over and over whenever you jump to the next \"level\", but the only thing that changes is the scenery and the numbers shown. You'd know this if you played any idler game in your life. And its also true for this game, but it adds a nice little twist. You actually feel that you start out more \"powerful\" than you were in previous levels just because of your interesting abilties keep transforming, plus you start out with more resources in the next level.\n\nAnother cool thing about the progression is that the game purposefully sends you back to previous levels where you're now too powerful for. Normally it would be optional for the player to visit them to simply admire the changes that happened to their power when they were stuck in those levels, but this game forces you to visit them, and its a really nice touch that I liked. I'm not sure if this was %100 on purpose but psyhcologically this is a really nice touch to the progress in the player's head more than the in-game stats.\n\nI liked the length of the game, because any more of this would be kind of an overkill, but I wish there was other content revolving around the same gameplay elements; like camp upgrades, cosmetics, maybe even other resources that we discover throughout the biomes, etc.\n\nThe only thing that I didnt liked about the game —and this is just a very small OCD type thing— is the exponential decrease of the picking shells up sequence. Because what do you mean I can pick up 1 quadrillion shells in a second but it makes me 3 seconds to pick up the last thousand shells??? I'm half-serious, but it just bugged me for some reason whenever I had to pick up shells from the chest.\n\nGreat, addicting game if you're looking for a single-sitting experience. If this didn't sound like a game you'd like, just know that it probably is. You'll know what I mean when you're tasting your god powers at the last level when you're just about to finish the game.", "author_steamid": "76561198956282494", "author_num_games_owned": 254, "author_num_reviews": 123, "author_playtime_forever": 309, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 309, "author_playtime_at_review": 309, "author_last_played": "2026-01-18T19:06:44+00:00"}

Developed and published by Gagonfe, the game centers on a senior turtle who decides to pivot late in life and start a jellyfish-based business, and from that deceptively simple premise emerges a charming blend of incremental progression, exploration, and underwater world-building. Rather than overwhelming the player with tutorials or complex systems, Shelldiver eases you in with a clear objective—dive, collect, upgrade, sell—and gradually expands that loop until it becomes a satisfying rhythm. It is a game designed to be approachable without feeling disposable, and that balance is what gives it staying power.\n\nThe core gameplay revolves around exploring the ocean depths to gather jellyfish and other resources, returning to shore, and reinvesting profits into better gear, abilities, and shop improvements. What makes this loop engaging is how steadily it evolves. Early dives feel simple and contained, but as upgrades accumulate, you begin to unlock new biomes that introduce different hazards, creatures, and collectibles. The game never abandons its cozy foundation, but it does offer enough variation to keep the routine from feeling repetitive. Resource management, equipment experimentation, and gradual optimization become part of the pleasure, yet none of it demands min-maxing or intense efficiency. Progress happens at the pace you want it to, letting the player enjoy the act of playing rather than chasing the endpoint.\n\nShelldiver’s visual identity plays a major role in its appeal. The pixel art is warm, expressive, and full of character, giving the underwater world a sense of friendliness rather than mystery or danger. The turtle protagonist is animated with personality, the jellyfish are whimsically designed, and the different aquatic regions each have distinct color palettes and environmental textures. A calm, looping soundtrack reinforces the meditative tone—never intrusive, never trying to steal the spotlight, but always helping the immersion. The interface is clean, readable, and inviting, which fits perfectly with a game meant to be relaxing rather than stressful. Every design choice seems aimed at making the player feel welcome.\n\nDespite its incremental structure, Shelldiver never fully embraces the “idle game” label. You remain directly involved—steering through currents, timing captures, choosing where to explore next, and actively shaping the shop’s growth. The game rewards curiosity, not just patience. There are decisions to make, even if the stakes remain low: Should you invest in harvesting efficiency or survivability? Explore a new biome or focus on stockpiling resources? Upgrade shop infrastructure or unlock new tools for deeper dives? These choices aren’t punishing, but they make progression feel intentional rather than automatic. That sense of gentle agency is one of the game’s greatest strengths.\n\nLike most cozy indie titles, Shelldiver does have limitations. The narrative is light enough that players seeking emotional arcs or dramatic storytelling may find it too minimal. The upgrade tree, while enjoyable, eventually plateaus, with late-game improvements feeling more like refinements than transformative additions. Some biomes share similar structural patterns, and once the core loop becomes familiar, the surprises become less frequent. None of these issues damage the experience, but they do highlight that Shelldiver is meant to be a contained, comforting journey rather than an endlessly escalating one. Its charm lies in knowing exactly how big it wants to be.\n\nWhat ultimately makes Shelldiver memorable is its sincerity. It doesn’t chase trends, shock value, or spectacle; it focuses on small pleasures—gradual improvement, playful discovery, and the satisfaction of turning humble beginnings into something meaningful. It respects the player’s time, encourages relaxation, and provides enough structure to feel rewarding without becoming demanding. It’s a game well-suited to short daily sessions, late-night unwinding, or slow, immersive weekends spent drifting between upgrades and ocean exploration.\n\nFor players who enjoy incremental progression, cozy aesthetics, and games built around steady personal accomplishment rather than pressure or urgency, Shelldiver is a delightful addition to the genre. It may not redefine resource-collection gameplay or visual-novel storytelling, but it delivers exactly what it promises with polish, heart, and personality. It’s the kind of title that leaves you smiling—not because it’s grand, but because it’s comfortable, thoughtful, and genuinely enjoyable to exist in.\n\nRating: 9/10", "author_steamid": "76561198367471798", "author_num_games_owned": 29582, "author_num_reviews": 12200, "author_playtime_forever": 716, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 716, "author_last_played": "2025-11-22T08:55:40+00:00"}

It offers a complete incremental experience, but trims the fat of the ceaseless grind other games offer and can be completed in a few joyful hours. Decision making, while never critical, seems to play a larger role in this game than most of the genre as well. Making the most of an expedition by choosing upgrades wisely and correctly prioritizing resources can be satisfying, if only for intrinsic value. Best of all, there's actual interactivity rather than mindlessly watching arbitrary numbers go up. The art is wonderful and the music, while lacking in variety, is pleasant. With a few tweaks, this game could have evolved into a nice arcade action title if the difficulty ramped up a little more and it leaned further into player skill and planning.

Maybe include upgrades to your submarine and have sections where you travel around between new islands only in the submarine, and these sections don't require you to worry about oxygen so can be longer more drawn out with tougher tasks to complete for a bigger thing to complete. \nI think it would be very welcome and easily just as fun as this game has been already.", "author_steamid": "76561199524100482", "author_num_games_owned": 0, "author_num_reviews": 3, "author_playtime_forever": 381, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 381, "author_playtime_at_review": 358, "author_last_played": "2026-01-23T18:02:25+00:00"}

Most games I have played have either been just good, okay, or quite sub-par - with unbalanced tech trees and borderline tedious moment to moment game play. \n\nThe first thing to note is the overall polish. The art style is extremely appealing and the color scheme pops with vibrant and dynamic colors. The game has a simple presentation, not bogging you down  with unnecessary fluff like dialogue or tutorials (really how I think these short games should play). There is juice in every aspect of this game; nothing ever got boring to look at. The character designs are nice to look at too!\n\nOn top of that, the player mechanics are fun and engaging. I had fun catching jellyfish and mining for resources. The progression, even though I'm essentially doing the same thing over and over again - did not ever feel stale (with only a few systems) and I think that largely has to do with the length of the game. I'm excited to go back to the tech-tree each time to see what I would unlock next. Power spike upgrades as well of QoL upgrades are spread out well. \n\nThe pacing was overall great, and I didn't think it over stayed its welcome. Upgrades felt punchy and worthwhile. I got enough time with the few mechanics where I thought I was able to explore them enough.. I would have definitely appreciated a longer game with more mechanics, but what is here is satisfying enough.\n\nThe ending of the game was great (completing the tech tree).. giving me opportunities to go back to older areas to acquire resources for upgrades to really help emphasize the power fantasy that I have achieved. The shape of the tech-tree was a nice tough as well. \n\nOne little critique is the automation portion at the end of the game, felt a little shoe-horned in. I think that felt a bit short, and felt sort of a last minute addition to the game; I would have liked to spend a little more time with that system (or just not have had it in the game).. but other than this, I can't help but to think good things about this game and is something I have replayed already.. extremely rare for someone like me to want to restart the game as soon as I have completed one.\n\n", "author_steamid": "76561198098592302", "author_num_games_owned": 1447, "author_num_reviews": 20, "author_playtime_forever": 877, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 871, "author_last_played": "2026-01-12T02:29:34+00:00"}

The game is just way too short.\r\nI had a lot of fun, considering it's a game all about shooting bubbles at jellyfish and lasers at rocks... and that's it. That's the game.\r\n\r\nYou get a ton of skill upgrades and unlock new areas, you level all the skills slowly till eventually you're an absolute badarse. Then you go to the next area and it's like, woah... why's everything so hard?\r\nWell, eventually you'll own that area too!\r\n\r\nI'd like to see a few things, like cosmetics. There are other turtles wearing hats and sunglasses, but your turtle gets nothing. The second I saw a chef's hat, I was like YES! I need one!\r\nYou don't get one.\r\nAnd that's a bit of a downer.\r\n\r\nBut if you don't care about cosmetics, then you'll have no issues with the game. It's quick, it has a price that matches it's quickness. I actually would've considered spending more on it. And will enjoy a replay some day.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay isn't exciting... but advancing up the skill tree is. You'll want to keep blasting bubbles just to get that next upgrade!\r\n\r\nDefinitely recommended. Thank you for reading (Or skipping to the end).

The pixel-art style is gorgeous, with cartoony outlines and bubbly shading that look cute and feel fun from start to finish. The music is great, and while the main island theme can get a little repetitive, the game is short enough that it doesn't end up being too much of a fuss. The sound design is brilliant, every action feels satisfying and the ascending scale played with each successful jellyfish hit as you approach the catching point gives a very intuitive grasp on how powerful your weapon feels and how strong the \"enemies\" are.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay loop borrows from a rising trend in indie games of \"Buster-style\" incremental games. These games generally follow a structure of: Start a run -> Destroy targets to gain resources -> Run out of time/HP/ammo -> Go to the upgrade screen -> Spend resources in a big tree of upgrades that boost your next runs and unlock more upgrades -> Start a run -> etc. etc. They tend to be short and sweet, and the fun emerges from the consistent ramp in power and pacing. Games like Max Manos, Digseum, A Game About Feeding A Black Hole, and of course Nodebuster are all good examples. Shelldiver is a standout game in this category. You dive into the ocean in your yellow submarine, you use your bubble gun to catch jellyfish and your plasma gun to mine resource clusters. Then once you run out of oxygen, ammo, storage space (or patience), you can resurface in your submarine. You sell your jellyfish for shells, and use them and the resources you mined to slowly unlock every skill in the massive skill tree.\r\n\r\nThe process starts off a little clunky. There are lots of steps involved in selling your jellyfish that feel strange and uncessary at first. You have to go to the shop, wait for the jellyfish to move from your inventory to the shop, wait for the shop to sell each item, then go to the treasure chest and wait for the shells to pour into your inventory. While it does feel satisfying on account of the responsive animations/effects and the top tier sound design, it comes across initially as an arbitrary delay in the process. However you quickly settle into the flow of the game, and soon enough upgrades speed up and eventually fully automate these previously awkward steps.\r\n\r\nNew mechanics/systems were interesting and intuitve, even if the game had some difficulty introducing unique upgrades like the starfish and puffers for the first time. The pacing was very well executed, with my only small gripe being that in the last half hour or so progression was so fast that it felt like I didn't have time to appreciate just how powerful I had become and how satisfying the gameplay was at that not-quite-final stage. The final few story upgrades needed to beat the game didn't exactly help this feeling of breezing by, but they did provide an opportunity to reflect on how much had changed since the start.\r\n\r\nThe progression underwater being mirrored on land is a great touch. Your island gains a few extra turtle inhabitants who repair the old house ruins and live peacefully, occassionally chatting to each other exclusively in emoticon text bubbles. And just like the spike in underwater power leads to a jackpot-esque barrage of effects and resource collection, at the crecsendo of your deep sea diving capabilities your island is filled with dozens of residents all hustling and bustling by on this now very crowded patch of land. It's yet another cute detail that ties Shelldiver into a beautifully polished package.\r\n\r\n\r\nShelldiver is a gem that is well worth its price despite only roughly 5 hours of playtime for a full completion. 9.5/10, go play this game.", "author_steamid": "76561199039059928", "author_num_games_owned": 132, "author_num_reviews": 26, "author_playtime_forever": 524, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 237, "author_playtime_at_review": 287, "author_last_played": "2026-01-26T09:46:39+00:00"}
