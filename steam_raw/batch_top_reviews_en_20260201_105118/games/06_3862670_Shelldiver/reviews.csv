This game is without a doubt the most well-designed resource management game i've played. Because it simply nails a lot of secret formulas that other games tried to replicate for so long but some of them failed miserably. And then the art style, the smooth animations and sound design is the casing that makes it so delightful. That's what makes Shelldiver so special and SO... SOOO addicting. I finished the game in 5 hours in one sitting but I could've finished it in 3 if I wanted to do so. But I just wanted to extend my playthrough as much as I could, thats how fun it was.

So, what gameplay element am I talking about when I say that ""this game nailed but other idlers couldn't""?

Progresion. Normally in any idler game, resources feel like you start the game over and over whenever you jump to the next ""level"", but the only thing that changes is the scenery and the numbers shown. You'd know this if you played any idler game in your life. And its also true for this game, but it adds a nice little twist. You actually feel that you start out more ""powerful"" than you were in previous levels just because of your interesting abilties keep transforming, plus you start out with more resources in the next level.

Another cool thing about the progression is that the game purposefully sends you back to previous levels where you're now too powerful for. Normally it would be optional for the player to visit them to simply admire the changes that happened to their power when they were stuck in those levels, but this game forces you to visit them, and its a really nice touch that I liked. I'm not sure if this was %100 on purpose but psyhcologically this is a really nice touch to the progress in the player's head more than the in-game stats.

I liked the length of the game, because any more of this would be kind of an overkill, but I wish there was other content revolving around the same gameplay elements; like camp upgrades, cosmetics, maybe even other resources that we discover throughout the biomes, etc.

The only thing that I didnt liked about the game —and this is just a very small OCD type thing— is the exponential decrease of the picking shells up sequence. Because what do you mean I can pick up 1 quadrillion shells in a second but it makes me 3 seconds to pick up the last thousand shells??? I'm half-serious, but it just bugged me for some reason whenever I had to pick up shells from the chest.

Great, addicting game if you're looking for a single-sitting experience. If this didn't sound like a game you'd like, just know that it probably is. You'll know what I mean when you're tasting your god powers at the last level when you're just about to finish the game.",76561198956282494,254,123,309,309,309,2026-01-18T19:06:44+00:00

Developed and published by Gagonfe, the game centers on a senior turtle who decides to pivot late in life and start a jellyfish-based business, and from that deceptively simple premise emerges a charming blend of incremental progression, exploration, and underwater world-building. Rather than overwhelming the player with tutorials or complex systems, Shelldiver eases you in with a clear objective—dive, collect, upgrade, sell—and gradually expands that loop until it becomes a satisfying rhythm. It is a game designed to be approachable without feeling disposable, and that balance is what gives it staying power.

The core gameplay revolves around exploring the ocean depths to gather jellyfish and other resources, returning to shore, and reinvesting profits into better gear, abilities, and shop improvements. What makes this loop engaging is how steadily it evolves. Early dives feel simple and contained, but as upgrades accumulate, you begin to unlock new biomes that introduce different hazards, creatures, and collectibles. The game never abandons its cozy foundation, but it does offer enough variation to keep the routine from feeling repetitive. Resource management, equipment experimentation, and gradual optimization become part of the pleasure, yet none of it demands min-maxing or intense efficiency. Progress happens at the pace you want it to, letting the player enjoy the act of playing rather than chasing the endpoint.

Shelldiver’s visual identity plays a major role in its appeal. The pixel art is warm, expressive, and full of character, giving the underwater world a sense of friendliness rather than mystery or danger. The turtle protagonist is animated with personality, the jellyfish are whimsically designed, and the different aquatic regions each have distinct color palettes and environmental textures. A calm, looping soundtrack reinforces the meditative tone—never intrusive, never trying to steal the spotlight, but always helping the immersion. The interface is clean, readable, and inviting, which fits perfectly with a game meant to be relaxing rather than stressful. Every design choice seems aimed at making the player feel welcome.

Despite its incremental structure, Shelldiver never fully embraces the “idle game” label. You remain directly involved—steering through currents, timing captures, choosing where to explore next, and actively shaping the shop’s growth. The game rewards curiosity, not just patience. There are decisions to make, even if the stakes remain low: Should you invest in harvesting efficiency or survivability? Explore a new biome or focus on stockpiling resources? Upgrade shop infrastructure or unlock new tools for deeper dives? These choices aren’t punishing, but they make progression feel intentional rather than automatic. That sense of gentle agency is one of the game’s greatest strengths.

Like most cozy indie titles, Shelldiver does have limitations. The narrative is light enough that players seeking emotional arcs or dramatic storytelling may find it too minimal. The upgrade tree, while enjoyable, eventually plateaus, with late-game improvements feeling more like refinements than transformative additions. Some biomes share similar structural patterns, and once the core loop becomes familiar, the surprises become less frequent. None of these issues damage the experience, but they do highlight that Shelldiver is meant to be a contained, comforting journey rather than an endlessly escalating one. Its charm lies in knowing exactly how big it wants to be.

What ultimately makes Shelldiver memorable is its sincerity. It doesn’t chase trends, shock value, or spectacle; it focuses on small pleasures—gradual improvement, playful discovery, and the satisfaction of turning humble beginnings into something meaningful. It respects the player’s time, encourages relaxation, and provides enough structure to feel rewarding without becoming demanding. It’s a game well-suited to short daily sessions, late-night unwinding, or slow, immersive weekends spent drifting between upgrades and ocean exploration.

For players who enjoy incremental progression, cozy aesthetics, and games built around steady personal accomplishment rather than pressure or urgency, Shelldiver is a delightful addition to the genre. It may not redefine resource-collection gameplay or visual-novel storytelling, but it delivers exactly what it promises with polish, heart, and personality. It’s the kind of title that leaves you smiling—not because it’s grand, but because it’s comfortable, thoughtful, and genuinely enjoyable to exist in.

-Shelldiver is a cute, cozy, and fun incremental game.  These devs did a terrific job of designing a smart and satisfying game that anyone can enjoy.  This game is extremely easy to learn and offers a simple, yet rewarding experience.  It's extremely easy and only offers about 4-5 hrs of content, but that's exactly what I was hoping for.  I paid less than $4 for this little gem, and I'm very happy with my purchase.

Consensus:
-Solid Game (Tier 3 and makes up 35% of my reviews).  This is such an easy game to recommend to anyone that has at least a sprinkling of interest in this genre.  It's not going to win game of the year award, but it will keep you busy and satisfied for an afternoon or two.

If you've ever started an incremental game, had a decent time, but felt like they always reach a point where the game wants to bore you as much as physically possible, this game is for you. It offers a complete incremental experience, but trims the fat of the ceaseless grind other games offer and can be completed in a few joyful hours. Decision making, while never critical, seems to play a larger role in this game than most of the genre as well. Making the most of an expedition by choosing upgrades wisely and correctly prioritizing resources can be satisfying, if only for intrinsic value. Best of all, there's actual interactivity rather than mindlessly watching arbitrary numbers go up. The art is wonderful and the music, while lacking in variety, is pleasant. With a few tweaks, this game could have evolved into a nice arcade action title if the difficulty ramped up a little more and it leaned further into player skill and planning.

The game has little story, but as you make upgrades in the skill tree you will notice your little island become more populated and more interactable. I accidentally got the achievement for high fiving a villager because I thought the NPC's were just part of the background (they are, but still).

The gameplay loop starts with you having to scavenge and manage oxygen, it doesn't stay that way for long though. If you have that power creep fantasy then this game will be perfect for you.

If you grew up in the 80s, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about—the old GB, NES, SNES, and Sega game covers. They often looked absolutely awesome. From the cover, you’d expect an epic game, only to pop the cartridge in and discover that the game and characters looked nothing like what the cover promised.
That's exactly how I feel about this game. I was expecting a turtle with a happy, :D face, but instead, I got a grumpy old turtle with a constant -_- expression.

What an incredible little game, the only negative I could find is that it ended.

Visually this game is incredible, every little interaction feels extremely polished, combine this with sounds so perfectly in line with what's going on it's crazy how well it scratches that itch somewhere deep in my brain. 
Each environment is different enough to not make it feel repetitive, but familiar enough to keep in line with the direction of the game. 

Gameplay is simple with a couple basic mechanics which work incredibly well, game also brings in some changes to make the levels more varied and that just makes it much more enjoyable.

Progression wise it is incredibly well balanced, every upgrade brings an improvement and I haven't found any filler upgrades that are there just to prolong the gameplay. (Visual & Sound design is also extremely satisfying in the upgrade screen)

I will be following this developer to see what new games they release and if an expansion or a sequel of Shelldiver drops I will 100% grab it.",76561198132562752,860,35,330,0,330,2025-11-25T11:45:23+00:00

So cute, so cosy, and feels so addictive to level up everything.
My hope for this game is that it becomes a stardew like situation where it expands on this initial island and diving setup. Just like how Stardew Valley starts off as farming but then has mining, fishing, foraging etc. along with tasks involving repairing stuff around the town with NPC cutscenes, I think this game could easily grow in that kind of manner over time.
It'd be great to have new little islands to travel to where there are new tasks with new rewards to be completed, new characters to interact with and build things around the island to show your development of the area for all the new turtles that move in, or something like that along those kinda lines. Maybe include upgrades to your submarine and have sections where you travel around between new islands only in the submarine, and these sections don't require you to worry about oxygen so can be longer more drawn out with tougher tasks to complete for a bigger thing to complete.

There's no variety though. You do the exact same thing through world 1-5, and I mean the exact same thing.
In incrementals you often get upgrades that open up new ways to play, getting to a new area means new mechanics and enemies, but not here.

World 1-1:
Few squids, little rocks

World 1-2
Few more squids, medium rocks

World 1-3
Few more squids, large rocks

World 2-1
Few squids, little rocks

World 2-2
Few more squids, medium rocks

World 2-3
Few more squids, large rocks

Nothing changes but the sprites. You do the same game 5 times, then upgrades just give up and are like ""Get 12 squids when you get one"", and ""You do X9999 damage""
Then you end the game.

It's so good in fact, I was left with wanting so much more. I hope the developer revisits this game and goes further with a sequel. Here are some ideas I'd like to see:

1) interacting with the turtles that appear on the island
2) a reason to crouch and jump on the island
3) a larger role for the submarine
4) larger levels with a more complex oxygen management system
5) more challenging jellies such as ones that harden up and require a shell to be broken with the plasma gun. Jellies that actively attack your oxygen supply, go after your loot box, or protect other more valuable jellies.
6) more than one island
7) building choices on the islands
8) cosmetic options
9) navigational challenges that utilize the skill tree such as blocked areas and hidden areas
10) interaction with the underwater environments such as discovering hidden treasure, allies, and tools",76561198038828192,0,16,614,0,610,2026-01-08T20:17:58+00:00

As an aspiring developer myself, I have been on a quest to understand this genre better by playing many incremental games, and this one really sets the bar high for the genre. Most games I have played have either been just good, okay, or quite sub-par - with unbalanced tech trees and borderline tedious moment to moment game play. 

The first thing to note is the overall polish. The art style is extremely appealing and the color scheme pops with vibrant and dynamic colors. The game has a simple presentation, not bogging you down  with unnecessary fluff like dialogue or tutorials (really how I think these short games should play). There is juice in every aspect of this game; nothing ever got boring to look at. The character designs are nice to look at too!

On top of that, the player mechanics are fun and engaging. I had fun catching jellyfish and mining for resources. The progression, even though I'm essentially doing the same thing over and over again - did not ever feel stale (with only a few systems) and I think that largely has to do with the length of the game. I'm excited to go back to the tech-tree each time to see what I would unlock next. Power spike upgrades as well of QoL upgrades are spread out well. 

The pacing was overall great, and I didn't think it over stayed its welcome. Upgrades felt punchy and worthwhile. I got enough time with the few mechanics where I thought I was able to explore them enough.. I would have definitely appreciated a longer game with more mechanics, but what is here is satisfying enough.

The ending of the game was great (completing the tech tree).. giving me opportunities to go back to older areas to acquire resources for upgrades to really help emphasize the power fantasy that I have achieved. The shape of the tech-tree was a nice tough as well. 

One little critique is the automation portion at the end of the game, felt a little shoe-horned in. I think that felt a bit short, and felt sort of a last minute addition to the game; I would have liked to spend a little more time with that system (or just not have had it in the game).. but other than this, I can't help but to think good things about this game and is something I have replayed already.. extremely rare for someone like me to want to restart the game as soon as I have completed one.

What I appreciated most is how cleanly the progression is paced. By the time you’ve bought your final upgrade, you’ve naturally unlocked every trophy. No filler, no pointless collectibles, no artificial padding. Just a tight, cozy experience that delivers exactly the amount of game it needs to.

I had a lot of fun, considering it's a game all about shooting bubbles at jellyfish and lasers at rocks... and that's it. That's the game.

You get a ton of skill upgrades and unlock new areas, you level all the skills slowly till eventually you're an absolute badarse. Then you go to the next area and it's like, woah... why's everything so hard?
Well, eventually you'll own that area too!

I'd like to see a few things, like cosmetics. There are other turtles wearing hats and sunglasses, but your turtle gets nothing. The second I saw a chef's hat, I was like YES! I need one!
You don't get one.
And that's a bit of a downer.

But if you don't care about cosmetics, then you'll have no issues with the game. It's quick, it has a price that matches it's quickness. I actually would've considered spending more on it. And will enjoy a replay some day.

The gameplay isn't exciting... but advancing up the skill tree is. You'll want to keep blasting bubbles just to get that next upgrade!

Definitely recommended. Thank you for reading (Or skipping to the end). Have a lovely day. <3",76561198035826989,814,311,254,0,254,2025-12-31T14:54:58+00:00

Shelldiver is a short and incredibly adorable game about exploring the ocean, upgrading your equipment, and rebuilding a quaint desert island that slowly fills with turtle friends. The pixel-art style is gorgeous, with cartoony outlines and bubbly shading that look cute and feel fun from start to finish. The music is great, and while the main island theme can get a little repetitive, the game is short enough that it doesn't end up being too much of a fuss. The sound design is brilliant, every action feels satisfying and the ascending scale played with each successful jellyfish hit as you approach the catching point gives a very intuitive grasp on how powerful your weapon feels and how strong the ""enemies"" are.

The gameplay loop borrows from a rising trend in indie games of ""Buster-style"" incremental games. These games generally follow a structure of: Start a run -> Destroy targets to gain resources -> Run out of time/HP/ammo -> Go to the upgrade screen -> Spend resources in a big tree of upgrades that boost your next runs and unlock more upgrades -> Start a run -> etc. etc. They tend to be short and sweet, and the fun emerges from the consistent ramp in power and pacing. Games like Max Manos, Digseum, A Game About Feeding A Black Hole, and of course Nodebuster are all good examples. Shelldiver is a standout game in this category. You dive into the ocean in your yellow submarine, you use your bubble gun to catch jellyfish and your plasma gun to mine resource clusters. Then once you run out of oxygen, ammo, storage space (or patience), you can resurface in your submarine. You sell your jellyfish for shells, and use them and the resources you mined to slowly unlock every skill in the massive skill tree.

The process starts off a little clunky. There are lots of steps involved in selling your jellyfish that feel strange and uncessary at first. You have to go to the shop, wait for the jellyfish to move from your inventory to the shop, wait for the shop to sell each item, then go to the treasure chest and wait for the shells to pour into your inventory. While it does feel satisfying on account of the responsive animations/effects and the top tier sound design, it comes across initially as an arbitrary delay in the process. However you quickly settle into the flow of the game, and soon enough upgrades speed up and eventually fully automate these previously awkward steps.

New mechanics/systems were interesting and intuitve, even if the game had some difficulty introducing unique upgrades like the starfish and puffers for the first time. The pacing was very well executed, with my only small gripe being that in the last half hour or so progression was so fast that it felt like I didn't have time to appreciate just how powerful I had become and how satisfying the gameplay was at that not-quite-final stage. The final few story upgrades needed to beat the game didn't exactly help this feeling of breezing by, but they did provide an opportunity to reflect on how much had changed since the start.

The progression underwater being mirrored on land is a great touch. Your island gains a few extra turtle inhabitants who repair the old house ruins and live peacefully, occassionally chatting to each other exclusively in emoticon text bubbles. And just like the spike in underwater power leads to a jackpot-esque barrage of effects and resource collection, at the crecsendo of your deep sea diving capabilities your island is filled with dozens of residents all hustling and bustling by on this now very crowded patch of land. It's yet another cute detail that ties Shelldiver into a beautifully polished package.


Shelldiver is a gem that is well worth its price despite only roughly 5 hours of playtime for a full completion. 9.5/10, go play this game.",76561199039059928,132,26,524,237,287,2026-01-26T09:46:39+00:00
