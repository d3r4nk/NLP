Let me preface this by making it very clear that I don't know a single thing about vTubers or Hololive.  But I'll be damned if this isn't a great game! I've played Vampire Survivors and many others like it and this is borderline criminal being free to play. It is very well made and executed and puts the vast majority of similar games of the genre to shame with the sheer number of characters, items to unlock and mini-games to keep you busy.

[b]Completed the game[/b]:
25hrs in and I've completed the game with Amelia from start to finish. I've gotten all her outfits, maxed out her bonuses, and I'm very close to purchasing the final stat points as well. The game is great. The stages got progressively harder and scaled quite nicely.

Solid, survivor-like game with a different twist. There is a ""home"" area where you can farm, fish, craft, cook, and gamble. Though it's super bare bones, once again, this game is free. The survivor portion of the game feels just as good (if not better) than a lot of the competition out there. It's pretty impressive. I have no idea what Holo-live is, but I've been on a suvivor-like kick lately, so I picked it up.

The one thing this game does better than many in the genre is make each character feel unique. Each vtuber has different skills and specials (3 unique skills each, and one ultimate) which allows them to play differently with different load outs. Some you will want to build with extra healing and ranged, and some you will do the opposite. Many of this genre's titles have clear winners with abilities and weapons you can pick, but I felt like I was playing differently when I was switching between characters.

That being said, there is still some room for improvement in the build diversity department. There aren't a ton of skills, but the combo system and stamps for your weapons helps quite a bit. Again, this game is free, and I would have gladly paid for this.

Overall 8/10 for the genre. Plenty of playtime, and plenty of achievements if you're into that. It's worth a download for sure.",76561198071681326,435,136,1438,0,1438,2025-08-14T00:58:33+00:00

*[I'M GOING TO TELL A LITTLE BIT OF HOW I GET INTO THIS GAME SO IN CASE YOU WANT TO GO TO MY REVIEW IMMEDIATELY, YOU CAN SCROLL BELOW]*

First of all, I knew about hololive before this game was released, and I can't say that I'm quite a fan of vtubers back then. In fact, I do enjoy watching them and their community doing some silly things and it looked fun lol. I also enjoy their memes. I do enjoy watching some vtubers but the only vtuber caught my attention here is fubuki, because I liked fox. I sometimes watched her stream when I feel like it during the pandemic time. after a while, I don't watch them anymore maybe because I got a bit bored and have things to do in my life after the pandemic. And then, after some time, some of my friends tried playing this game and they said it was quite fun. They even tell me that I should give this game a shot. Well, since from the look of it really convinced me, I decided to try the game (I also like roguelike games so that also what attracted me into this game aside from using hololive characters). At first I was quite confused because of the item effects and levelling up weapon system here looked new to me lol. But my friend explained how the system works, so I began to get the gist of it. After a while, I think I'm starting to get addicted with the game. This is really a worthwhile experience. So I'm going to tell you from what I experienced playing this game.

[MY OPINIONS]
First of all, if you're a fan of indie games or roguelike games, you should give this game a try
There are 9 stages here so far for now, and each stages poses different random occurrence and monsters, so they have their own uniqueness. It's really fun for me because you can try to discover the item yourself and play it in your style. This game can be played both in a casual and competitive way (since it has leaderboard system). Plus, you can also combine two specific items into one powerful items, and that's really cool. What's more, you can also use specific items to combine into that one super powerful items called ""Super Collab"" which make you able to defeat hordes at ease. There are only 5 of these super collab for now.

Next is the characters. No need to worry about getting bored easily with few characters because there are A LOT of these playable characters available. each have their own advantages, skills, and uniqueness. There are characters who can withstand big damage like tanks, some deals damage (either close or long range), and some are coin farmers (yea you heard me right :v). There are still a lot of playstyles depend on how you want to play and enjoy the game.
Oh right, talking about playstyles, the shop here isn't as complicated is you think. You can customize your playstyles and modes here like disabling specific items or making the enemies stronger, harder, depends on how challenging you want the game to be. Upgrades are easy to handle but in case you want to obtain coins faster to buy things on shop, you can try using an orange haired characters using paintbrush named Kiara. She's the easiest character to use since she can sustain damage and heal herself (plus she can also withstand moderate damage). after completing one stage with her, go to Houshou Marine's banner (The one with red hair and eye patch, pirate appearance) and pull for her. then next stage use her and then make sure you use the item that boost coin farming. And then BOOM! you can obtain half a hundred thousands in short times (can be more depends on which item you use and what stage).

And then, in case you don't feel like fighting enemies and want to feel a casual experience, they have holohouse mode there. Think of it as... the sims? no, maybe like gta but friendlier? no, I'm not sure how I should explain this but yeah you can interact with other holo members here, fishing, farming, doing parkours on castle, playing casino with pekomama (I don't even know how to play game that involves casino, poker cards, or any gambling thing). You can also decorate your home here based on your taste. I like how this game able to provide both immersive and casual experience so you can get the best of both.

[SUMMARY]
I'm sorry if I am being exaggerating, but lemme just tell y'all what I thought in short. This game has it's own unique experiences. You can fight different enemies on different stages with different characters using different items. Shops and upgrades are surprisingly easy to comprehend and you can customize your playstyle there depends on your taste. And in case you're not in mood for some violence, you can also try the holohouse mode which will provide you some casual and relaxing experiences. But yeah, for now, there's no multiplayer experiences so if you wanna play with your friend, you can't since it's quite tricky to make a server running here.

No need to give a second thought about this game if I could suggest, just try it. Worth the time I'd say in case you want to relieve stress and had fun. but beware, to me this game is only fun if you play it once in a while, because if you have spent too much time like playing this everyday, you'll get bored eventually. For those who have maxed out the content like (Like unlocked all the unlockables), maybe you can try leave this game for a while and then come back when you're in the mood to play this game.

I hope my bad english languages didn't cause any offensive response or misunderstanding. Have fun everybody! :3",76561199203308187,0,2,2633,0,2619,2025-08-17T10:26:40+00:00

I think this is a competent interpretation of the genre with a lot of fun casual side content and potential time wasters (such as a casino with a SA style race and combat mode, and fishing)

I think this game stands on its own even if you're unfamiliar with the premise. Obviously everything is a reference, but so was Vampire Survivors and I think that game is cohesive even if you aren't familiar with Castlevania and weird Italian puns. The levels border on very easy, with me fairly easily beating the first two stages my first time through, but the hard stages are fairly difficult and boss mechanics show promise of difficulty.

The game opens with the familiar field level that all these games start with, with very familiar enemy patterns and items. However, after the first run it diverges significantly. things like weapon modifiers and skills for specific holo live characters add a lot of variety, weapons function different, and the combo items (called collabs here) have felt really satisfying. 

All the art is cute and very well done, characters have a lot of costumes as well. The base is a really interesting mechanic, and I could definitely see spending several hours in that mode alone.  Wouldn't be bad for a 5-10 dollar game, but it's phenomenal for a free one.",76561198025024010,2245,229,546,0,111,2025-10-20T02:52:07+00:00

Now, as for the Hololive games, well, Holocure: Save The Fans, Holo X Break, and some of their upcoming Hololive titles, might be some of the best indie games that are out there, and as for this video game, I honestly think that it is a very solid title on Steam, though I wish it went to other consoles as well.  Yes, it is a Vampire Survivors clone, but it is also, depending on how you set the game up, either easier, or harder, to play than that video game.

The Good:

-Your controls mostly control well.
-You have a lot of content on here, and not just the main game as well.
-I like the added minigames, which is something that Vampire Survivors does not offer.
-You can decorate your own home in this video game.
-Your characters have a wide variety of attacks.
-This game is FREE!

The Bad:

-I would like to see new free DLC for the newer Hololive talent to join the game as playable characters.  Granted, 47 of them is plenty, but Vampire Survivors has over 100 of them, and I know that Hololive has at least that many vtuvers in their agency.
-There needs to be better ranged attacks in the game.
-I would like to see some weapons that are like the old Midway video games like Robotron 2084, Robotron X, Smash T.V., and Total Carnage, as in different ranged weapons that do different levels of damage, and not in slow strings of pew pew pew.  Even having some weapon upgrades like in Xenocrisis would help, but it could be adapted to the game, e.g., having skill trees that can, say, make a scythe attack enemies in all directions at a certain level, send smaller scythes, like Death does in the Castlevania/Demonic Castle Dracula video games, or both, and more, etc.
-Bosses need better attack patterns.
-Regular grunt enemies need more variety in their attacks, instead of becoming merely attack sponges.
-Sometimes, the directional controls act wonky and they keep trying to move you in a direction that you do not want to go, which can be a VERY bad thing when fighting off a mob of enemies.
-We need more stages in this game because 5 of them just are not enough.
-A Maze Option would be nice, as that would be a welcome throwback to Robotron 2084, Robotron X, Smash T.V., Total Carnage, and Xenocrisis.

Still, if you can overlook the flaws, this is a pretty good video game.",76561199123084907,0,2,323,0,323,2025-11-12T03:55:23+00:00

It's a free game, and those can be a mixed bag on Steam, but this is, as the tiger-head cave entrance in Disney's Aladdin says, a 'diamond in the rough'.  

It takes the Vampire Survivors approach; fun bullet-heaven game, where you get strong enough to massively overpower the overwhelming enemy numbers.  

It doesn't just copy it though, it adds a bunch of extra things to the formula; a 'Holo-house' side area which you can decorate, fish and chill with the cast you've unlocked through a fun gacha mechanic.  

Don't worry, I mentioned gacha yes, but there's absolutely no microtransactions, no ads, no pressure to spend a single thing apart from your time.  The gacha uses in-game currency (coins) and is used to unlock and strengthen your characters by a %, in addition to the familiar meta-progress of increasing stats like HP, attack, defense, skill banishes and rerolls amount, etc.  

You don't need familiarity with VTubers to enjoy it. The core gameplay stands perfectly well on its own. If you do know the talents, the personality touches in their abilities and voice lines add a nice layer without feeling forced. It runs smoothly on Steam Deck, on the pc with a controller or with mouse and keyboard and It includes a solid list of achievements for people who like to hunt them. 

The developer keeps releasing free updates with new characters, stages, and features, which is crazy because the amount of characters is already huge and each one doesn't just start with a unique weapon and a little extra caveat, they all have their own unique set of skills that can be picked and levelled in-game. 

It's free, give it a shot if you like this kind of game, and I almost guarantee you won't regret it it has a 99% positive rating with nearly 40k reviews for a very good reason.",76561198028350105,0,25,913,27,913,2026-01-18T17:28:45+00:00

Joking, challenging, but above all affectionate for its VTubers and players. Weapons and items follow the theme accurately, with household items like glowsticks and microphones filling up the player’s armory. It’s a fun theme for a roguelike, and never got old or felt out of place for the duration of my playthrough. There are some clear in-jokes for weapons like lava buckets and sausages, and I honestly enjoy that. I especially love that the jingle for treasure chests is Ochame Kinou, a perfect choice for VTubers. The first time I heard it I did a double-take; it was just too good.

Once I got my bearings in the first level, I quickly realized that the biggest boon to Holocure’s combat is speed and variety. The roster and item pool is staggeringly large, and each Holo has a unique ability that helps turn the tide of battle. There’s nothing better than stacking kills and EXP until the field gets too hot, popping an ability, then strafing out of the fray with your health intact - or in some cases, having any HP left at all. The default run speed is already higher than Vampire Survivors, and rapidly builds with upgrades. The only way is up, and thank goodness for that. By the last few levels, I was blitzing across the stage with no problems.

My favorite part about HoloCure is the stages. Something different is tested in each one, from the horizontal focus of level two to the active threat management of level four. I hesitate to speak more on each one; they're beautifully designed arenas that encourage the player to push further every time. The music complements the stages, especially the Hard mode ones. The soundtrack in general is terrific and deserves major props. So what issues are there with HoloCure?

That’s the hardest part: I can’t think of any - I can only point out the solutions. One of my issues with the roguelike formula is the possible tedium that can be generated by shop menus. The relentless grind for more currency by replaying levels is an unwelcome one, and one that can quickly snowball into a major issue if the gameplay isn't up to snuff. This is a problem that is curtly solved by HoloCure, as it has two solutions: snappy, twin-stick shooter gameplay, and the Holo House. In the former’s case, leveling is quick and the vastness of the item pool means a new strategy can be taken each time. For instance, some runs might benefit from taking ‘Halu’, an item that increases enemy spawns and strength, but also the amount of currency you accrue. Following up on the latter, the Holo House is a home base for the player, filled with a variety of activities that can generate revenue. Fishing, worker management, and a huge casino are all very viable ways of getting currency, and also run in tandem with the base game: you can grow plants and put goons to work, play a level, then come back to reap the rewards. It's a fantastic way of eliminating the grind, and it had me coming back on a nearly daily basis. The fishing minigame is fun, the interactions with the other characters are cute, and it's just a blast to play. The dual experience of fun levels and money management creates an ecosystem where something is happening every second, with no moment wasted.

So yes. This is my GOTY for 2025, if we’re just talking about games I played that year. It’s joyous, playful, and clearly made with a lot of care.",76561198063145135,657,32,1603,0,1603,2026-01-13T22:50:07+00:00

What an adorable lovely game... FULL of content, and it's free... no filthy micro-transactions or anything! Over 16hrs in, but there is still so much to do and discover.

How do I say it... a certain bullet hell/heaven game inspired this mainly, but HoloCure hides soooo much more, and it's all themed about our HoloLive Oshsis.
Play the main game, yes, then explore the HoloHouse, make your own desing, mine and plant, go to casino and lose your chips to IRyS in rock-paper-scissors.

I personally had a lot of fun with Holocure in its early stages and participated in the Discord community for a time. Roboco was my favourite for her simplicity yet very fast XP gain + battery collection gimmick, and a really satisfying main weapon(when fully leveled, it changes from a pew pew gun to a giant plasma cannon).

Since then, it has also implemented a bunch of other completionist side content, such a fishing minigame, building your own house, gambling in a casino(purely ingame currency, no IRL money involved), and its own version of Jump King. You might need to look at the wiki to figure out the item combinations(called ""collabs"") even if you have some familiarity with Hololive.

positives:
1) Strikes balance between player skill and rng. 
Game allows player to exploit it in a way that it feels intended. Rng is supporting game, not defining it. Its unfortunate that most games of this genre are either pure rng(Mgeabnko), or balacned in such way, that rng and skill dont matter(mobile VS clones)

2) Easy to learn hard to master.
Game is easy and may feel boring when you have a set of strong collabs you are always doing. Think about characters who feel weak. Are they weak? Or they are not supposed to be used they way you use them? Should you even try figuring it out? What if by learning limits of weaker characters, you could find holes in your logic and become more capable in real life? Thing about this game, is that you dont need all the characters maxed to beat it, you dont even need to summon because Orange Cat waifu available from the beginning will carry you. That is if you play the game to farm coins and finish maps. Is that the only thing you want to do?

3) Characters are gameplay enabling.
One problem that other games of this genre have is their characters. They are different in superficial ways, like a starting weapon(VampireSurwives and all of its clones), or their abilities interfere so much with core game, that half of them are unplayable.(Mgebanok - labubu of the genre) 

4) Grind is simple.
Some of the grind is passive accumulation over time. But the most powerful bonuses are farmed in an hour, and then you never have to do for the character again. Maxing out a character takes 45-60 minutes depending on how fast player chooses power ups. And there is around 50 of them, conveniently putting, in my opinion, the longest COMPLETIONIST grind in the game to <50 hours (give me slack it could be taking 3 runs to max instead of 2 that i used but still can be done in an hour for each charatcter) IF player chooses to max out every character fandom like this, then by the end, other main game features should be maxed or close to maxed on its own.

5) Good achievemns.
Most achievements are some form of challenge, to step out of comfort zone. Its interesting to do.

6) All of the above, but the game got a theme to it. Colourful pixelated anime girls are actully real people. You can find most of them on youtube and, either fall acompletely in love, or become hopelessly disappointed. But disappointment only lasts until you find the real heroine. To help you In your quest to finding Oshi, i will tell you both important secrets: ""Good people don't get a lot of views"" and ""Bad people don't get a lot of views"". So i sincerely hope, that you will find your Oshi. And when you do, and as a result end up kanojo-less, remember advice that helped you on the way there.


negatives:
Negatives dont come enumerated. They are instead a progression of life after playing this game.

- Become part of the crew, part of the ship.
- Compulsively learning nihongo.
- Start liking Shoujo Ai.
- Must always make time to watch your Oshi.
- Have to buy merch.
- Have to cosplay girls, despite being man.
- Can you show yourself to your parents in a sorry state such as this. Embarassing.
- Isolating in room.
- Order sushi.
- Polish katana replica.
- Want to go to japan, but can't, because unemployed and spend all money on posters, plushies, and figurines(including real life size) of the Oshi.",76561199838466442,0,1,2368,0,1138,2025-11-25T10:59:21+00:00

Genuinely, the most important thing I could say about this game is that it stands on its own apart from Hololive at least for me. If you’re like me and would be worried you might not enjoy the game with a lack of knowledge about VTubers then don’t be. The extent of what I know about them really is that I listen to some of their music, and that I’ve obviously seen some of them around online recognizing some of the designs here and there. Quite frankly I don’t really get it to be honest, the success of VTubers has always been a mystery to me. I personally don’t see the appeal, but I do see the appeal of this game.

Like the title says this is most definitely the best survivors-like game I’ve played to date as of writing this review. If you like this type of game you will definitely enjoy this one. The thing that brings it to a status of my favourite I’ve played is that you can tell lots of work went into the game all for the price tag of absolutely nothing because it’s a fan project.

[h3]Here are some highlights for me (as of November 2025):[/h3]

- 48 unique playable characters, all with their very own unique starting weapon, special attack that has a set cool-down time, and three skills. None of the characters weapons, specials, or skills end up feeling very samey which is awesome. I imagine most of them are probably references to the VTuber the character is made from but I don’t really get any of them.

- Overall the art is really amazing, tons of unique sprites for enemies, weapons, items, skills, bosses, etc. A big strong suit for the game which makes sense as I believe the dev is an artist not a game dev.

- Boatloads of content if you enjoy the mindless grind like I do.

- I really like the “Fandom” system in the game which rewards XP to the character you complete a stage on and they level up and gain bonuses to HP, attack, and start the game with more of their skills unlocked so you don’t need to use your hard earned level-ups on getting them. (Curse you achievements for getting every character to Gachikoi level on fandoms but I still did it…)

- Very satisfying sense of progression because of the Fandom system but also just the base stat upgrades and such in the shop that you spend your cash on.

So the hours displayed above the review is about how long it took me to very casually, not really efficiently “100%” the game which in my opinion was going for all [b]201 in-game achievements (as of writing this review),[/b] and ignoring stuff like the scam items in Usada’s Casino, and getting all of the Fan Letters that I didn’t exactly deem necessary as part of the 100% completion. Cause those are super grind money, and complete RNG.

As a non-fan of Hololive the Holo House feature was an absolute nothing burger for me so I didn’t think it was really worth leaving my opinion on, I suppose it’s probably great for fans. You can decorate a house with a bunch of stuff to make it look how you want. I personally would have preferred the effort that went into Holo House to have gone into just more main game content, but I understand why people might like it.

[h3]Included in the Holo House are:[/h3]

- Your obligatory fishing mini-game.

- Casino to gamble in (hell yeah).

- A place to grow crops and a place to cook with those crops to get food items that will give you buffs in stage mode.

- A Jump King style mini-game called Tower of Suffering.

- A fence area where you keep little critters and they generate you money passively if you feed them fish and vegetables you grow.

- A spot made for mining ores and chopping down trees so you can craft items to make some cash if you’re looking for a change of scenery.

Despite the mindless grind it sometimes became, the game is completely free, just try it. Like it or don’t like it I don’t care but I definitely agree with the very high positive review rate that it has gotten. [i][b]If you have ever held off on trying it because of your lack of knowledge of the subject . I don’t know almost anything about these characters or references and I spent 160 hours in the game. If that’s not enough I don’t know what is.[/b][/i]",76561198862414770,319,24,9716,0,9716,2025-11-13T04:27:43+00:00

So when a fan-made game of Hololive based on Vampire Survivors (i haven't play it and i might soon) called Holocure released i was really shocked and hype to try it out. It was fun, chaotic and addicting more than anything else.

Two things that made me appreciate this game every time i play it, the first one is that it has a gacha system for the characters but it won't cost you any payment instead the characters are unlocked by collecting coins in the game and then spending them a thousand at a time on an in-game gacha mechanic. Yu, the developer is keen to emphasise that the gacha is purely in-game currency and does not involve any sort of monetisation, you just need to play the game a few times to unlock the additional characters.

Second and this might be the best thing about Holocure is that you don't need to know anything whatsoever about Hololive to appreciate it. If you have never explored VTuber culture at all, the game’s intro sequence provides a brief bit of context, and from there the playable characters can all simply be seen as cute girls with unique abilities. At the other end of the spectrum, however, if you are deeply immersed into VTuber culture and Hololive culture specifically then the game is absolutely rammed full of references and in-jokes that will continually delight your experience.",76561199863742081,272,8,109,0,7,2025-11-12T15:25:00+00:00

Aside from the main mode that's essentially Vampire Survivors, you have other things to do to kill time and make grinding the in-game money easier, as it is needed to unlock characters, rank characters up (with dupes), and upgrade stats. There is a fishing mini-game, a basic farm to care for, a place for your ""workers"" to make you money, a spot to mine ores and chop trees, a Jump King like mini-game, and a casino with many different ways to gamble your in-game money. While on their own they wouldn't be much, how they are integrated with the main mode and the world of Hololive & their talents makes them pretty fun and charming areas to grind.

With how much care, content, and attention to detail went into this game, all while being fully free, I must recommend it to anyone who likes these types of games or anything Hololive related.",76561199013600382,46,4,867,0,730,2025-10-23T03:07:24+00:00

- Melee
- Ranged
- Orbital (meanin' like you have objects swirl around you and all that jazz.)

It's a rougelite that many might compared to a game like Vampire Survivors and they state that themselves in the ABOUT section. Aside from that it does have some bullet hell aspects which makes me feel right at home, ze! 

Switching between characters keeps the entertainment fun and wild along with the various weapons to equip and the collab feature to follow! Seeing all the chaos and beautiful color flashes brings a tear to my eye. 

Outside of the endless wave of enslaved fans there are plenty other features outside to creatin' a perfect house for you and your fellow tubers.

* being able to swap aiming modes between the direction you're moving and your mouse, this feature alone sets this game far above vampire survivors in my eyes, as it allows every weapon to be as viable as the rest. this may be a skill issue, as i find myself actively avoiding weapons like the knives in Vampire Survivors.
*in certain maps such as Halloween Castle, shadows are cast off of enemies, the player, and the environment from the moon at the top of the map.

Rating: 4.5/5
Genre: Roguelike / Action / Casual
Developer: Kay Yu

HoloCure – Save the Fans! is a fast-paced, fan-made roguelike that blends satisfying gameplay with a vibrant tribute to the world of VTubers. Featuring characters from the Hololive universe, this game delivers an addicting mix of auto-attacking chaos, upgrade strategy, and surprising depth—all packaged in charming pixel art and supported by a community that clearly loves it.

The setup is simple and quirky: Hololive talents must rescue their fans, who’ve been brainwashed into attacking them. You select a character, each with unique abilities and weapons, and take to the battlefield to mow down waves of fan-shaped enemies. The gameplay is easy to grasp but offers rich layers of progression through upgrades, weapon evolutions, and character synergies.

Each run is driven by your choices—defeating enemies grants experience, allowing you to pick from random upgrades that enhance damage, survivability, or unlock new weapons. As the chaos increases, the game encourages smart decision-making: combine the right weapons and you'll unlock devastating ""collab"" or ""super collab"" forms that completely change the tide of battle.

What truly makes HoloCure shine is the level of polish and care put into every detail. Every Hololive talent has been faithfully reimagined with unique skills that reflect their personalities and lore. Despite being made by a small team, the animations are smooth, the pixel art is crisp, and the combat is incredibly responsive. It's clear this is a game made with love—and it shows in every frame.

Outside of combat, the game offers additional features like a home base called Holo House, where players can relax, farm, fish, decorate, and engage in light minigames. These breaks from battle add a cozy, wholesome layer that balances out the intensity of the main gameplay.

Despite being completely free, HoloCure boasts a level of content and replayability that rivals many paid titles. There are dozens of characters to unlock, plenty of achievements to chase, and multiple difficulty levels that scale as your skills grow. Whether you're new to the genre or a seasoned player looking for the next great time-sink, there's plenty to enjoy here.

Why I Recommend HoloCure – Save the Fans!

HoloCure isn’t just a fan game—it’s one of the most polished and genuinely fun entries in the auto-battler roguelike genre. It combines engaging combat, a ton of variety, and a playful charm that’s impossible not to appreciate. Whether you’re a Hololive fan or have never watched a VTuber in your life, the core gameplay is strong enough to hook anyone who enjoys fast-paced action and satisfying progression systems.

With zero cost and zero microtransactions, it’s a generous gift to the gaming community. It’s fun, it’s frantic, and it’s full of personality. If you’re looking for your next addictive game to sink hours into, HoloCure – Save the Fans! is an easy recommendation.",76561199215715149,259,231,20,0,20,2024-04-23T12:16:50+00:00

The gameplay loop is satisfying, it's aesthetically very charming and polished, and the level of variety accessible is honestly insane. There is a horde of characters to play as, and each has a relatively unique weapon and unique skills which you can either build around or just focus on the non-character weapons and items to make your build work. The number and variety of weapons and items, and their fusions (collabs), in combination with the 9 different stages the game offers, creates for a significant amount of replayability.

The game definitely leans into and encourages this replayability, perhaps to a fault - getting all the achievements looks to be somewhat grindy in nature, requiring you to play/clear several 20-30 minute rounds as every single one of the 45ish characters to get max fandom level with all of them. It reminds me of DK64, a game that was reasonably criticized for its insane level of collectibles. But frankly, getting 100% is not mandatory and in my opinion provides a high-level goal / context for the replayability the game offers that I find personally nice.

Also, if you get bored of all this? The game offers a whole miniature animal crossing side game that loosely integrates with the main game. It's remarkable in my mind, that this free game offers so much content and variety, and manages to somehow avoid falling victim to scope creep.

The game is deeply charming and you can tell that it was crammed full of passion and love for the vtuber community. Practically everything is some level of reference so if you ARE familiar with the vtuber scene, you will get a kick out of this aspect. Even if you aren't, the charm doesn't require prior knowledge to appreciate. Before playing this, I could name like three of the vtubers you can play as and now maybe I can name five?

It's really good.",76561198021226399,0,7,2671,0,1809,2025-07-21T22:39:36+00:00

No matter who your oshi is, you can play her without getting punished for it (unless the gacha system hates you, like it does me). And the kits make sense, the in-jokes are good, and with weapon and item variety you can get a ton of different builds going.

The main game has you surviving wave after wave of enemies (similar to Vampire Survivors), which can get quite hectic, but becomes very satisfying once you start upgrading the powerful weapons.
The other half of the game has you doing more relaxing things, such as fishing, tending crops, and designing your own house, which makes for a nice break from the main game and mixes things up quite a bit.
These two modes are easily the best part of the game and make for a very enjoyable experience that has a ton of replay value.

The latest big content update however included two things that I really did not like; gambling and rage bait.
There's a casino where you can do things like play blackjack and slot machines, meaning rewards are now locked behind luck based mechanics. And there's also the mini game which has you trying to climb to the top of a tower (clearly inspired by Jump King). It's a mode that's deliberately designed to make you angry and I did not enjoy it.

Since I don't have a gaming PC, I try to stick with games that are verified for Steam Deck, however, I really wanted to give this one a try and I was not disappointed. Though if the developers are able to get this fully verified I would really appreciate it (it feels like minor things too. If they are able to add controller icons on the menus and add an in-game keyboard, then it should be fine, right?).

The refund feature of skill points / Cash a a really good implementation. 

The Refund Option is with combination with the high amount of items a really good option to experiment with everything which delivers the Game. 
Each char has its own pros and cons. 
And a sep item / skill set which is unique for them. 
Weapons cant be swaped but ranked. 

A decent thing is the Balance between Idols, Fans, Bosses and parameters like Hp, Damage, Skills etc.

Beyond individual character care, HoloCure’s attention to detail is phenomenal. From the intricately designed pixel art, which lovingly captures the essence of each member, to the soundtrack that celebrates Hololive’s iconic themes, it’s clear this is a project built on admiration rather than just nostalgia.

As a fan, you'll find warmth in every corner, from the shop’s gacha system (where you recruit talents like a proper Hololive fan would!) to the enemy mobs filled with hilarious nods to VTuber culture. The developers genuinely pour heart into balancing gameplay so no character feels neglected, which is rare for a game with such a large and growing cast.

Ultimately, HoloCure stands as a beautiful tribute to Hololive and its fans, proving that with passion and dedication, fan projects can rival even officially licensed games. Every character is treated with care, their personalities infused into the mechanics, ensuring that no matter who you pick, you’ll feel the warmth of the Hololive universe.

It might start off pretty easy, but later levels become very intense and enter the bullet-hell territory, which keeps you on the edge of the seat because you can die anytime if you are caught mispositioned, which is pretty engaging.

All the songs are remixes of song by v-tubers and all have amazing 8-but arrangement, incredible stuff.

There is also a ""animal crossing"" world where you can fish, build your house and even a ""jump king"" minigame when you become tired of running from enemies and bullets.

I'd also consider it a little more fun to come back to versus similar games. Replayability is where most SHMUPs kind of suffer from lack of numerous levels/stages. Side scrolling or bottom/top scrollers are somewhat repetitive, because of more obvious spawn locations (example: If you play a stage of a scroller repeatedly, you know where to initially position yourself to take out enemies faster, so predictability kind of impacts how likely you might enjoy playing a game again).

With this game, it's more like you know what enemies to expect, so you prepare for it in that manner instead. Positioning's important, but how each stage plays out feels different because of how you choose to move, environmental attacks, and how enemies spawn. Not to say the game isn't challenging enough, but it's easier to get into because you don't really deal with projectiles as often when starting out. Anyone who plays this genre enough though will probably power through it with ease.

Something most SHMUPs get right is the variety of characters, weapons, and items that manipulate how you might position and attack. For that matter, I'd say more of the challenge comes from beating it with every character and working towards certain weapon/item builds. Whether or not one wants to play all the stages with this massive roster probably depends on the person themselves, but I'd say it's worth playing as much, if not more, than other SHMUPs. You'll probably enjoy it more if you're familiar with HoloLive, as some of these characters and their abilities are based on their respective memes, but I wouldn't let that get in the way of enjoying it if you arent familiar. That was partly what kept me from playing it at first, but I like this a bit more than scrolling SHMUPs.

Also, while I don't necessarily enjoy this part of the game, there's a home decoration, casino, farm (for fishing, treecutting, stone mining, planting crops, cooking, and worker management to collect money), and a mini-game similar to Jump King. They're nice, but the part I don't really like is how you can use these to create items for the main game. Admittedly, one of the items do come in handy for the 4th Stage on Hard, but I don't like how I have to invest time in minigames to get those items. Fortunately, there's an upgrade that lets you get materials needed for these items from drops in the main game, but I wouldn't rely too heavily on randomized drops. (I also only beat the game in a few days, so the amount of materials I got from the main game weren't bountiful).

For anyone starting out, I'd recommend using starter characters to get a feel for the game, then unlocking characters good for farming Holocoins to unlock other characters and upgrades faster. I used Pekora, because you only need to build HoloCoin farming items, and her abilities and weapons do the rest of the work. I read somewhere there's better characters for farming, because Pekora's ""high risk, high reward"", but Piggy Bank is really good on her, because she has a skill that lets her recover health when collecting coins; fortunately, Piggy Bank gives you free coins just for walking. Although the healing output's not overall impressive, it's still good because you generally kite enemies in this game. Plus, I feel her gacha abilities along with other coin farming items are enough. Basically, I got all the characters and upgrades doing this while only working to beat all the stages. I'll probably have everything unlocked and all characters at minimum lvl 21 (21 is where everyone gets their max stats) very soon playing the last stage a couple more times with Pekora.",76561198116664055,237,7,5615,0,2069,2025-07-01T15:04:32+00:00

But HoloCure is more than just addictive gameplay. The attention to detail and love for the Hololive IP is evident in every pixel.

3. The side content were fun too, farming and blacksmithing to up my stat were a bit repetitive but you can ignore them, fishing was just my main way of making money and catching all the golden variant were painful, I like the pekora Casino i spent a lot of time there to get all the stuff pekomama was selling, and i got to decorate a bit which was fun since it didnt have the best customizability, and for the jump king tower was simply PAINFUL

With engaging mechanics, a charming pixel art style, and an ever-growing roster of characters, HoloCure is a must-play for both Hololive fans and roguelike enthusiasts. Its has a minigame lobby too like casino, fishing, even ""jump king"" minigame which its very addictive to play and more... And mostly i like the pixelart style of this game

It is okay if you not a Hololive fans it can still be enjoyed by everyone.
