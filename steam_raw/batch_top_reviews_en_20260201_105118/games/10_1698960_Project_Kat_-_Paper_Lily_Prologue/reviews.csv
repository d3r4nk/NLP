It’s shorter and more compact, but that actually works in its favor. The whole game feels like a tightly crafted introduction to this universe, with the same eerie charm and unsettling atmosphere that made Paper Lily so memorable. The storytelling is really sharp. Kat herself is a great protagonist sarcastic, curious, and just a little reckless and the game uses her personality to pull you into situations that feel harmless at first but slowly twist into something much darker. The puzzles are simple but clever, the choices feel meaningful even in a short runtime, and the branching paths make it worth replaying just to see how differently things can unfold. What impressed me most is how much mood it manages to create with such a small space. The lighting, the quiet sound design, the little moments where the environment shifts when you’re not looking it all builds this creeping tension without going for cheap scares. By the end, you can really see the foundation of everything Paper Lily expands on. As a free prologue, it does exactly what it needs to: it stands on its own while making you want more. If you’re into atmospheric horror adventures with personality and style, Project Kat is absolutely worth the playthrough.",76561198062506049,990,918,77,0,77,2025-11-24T16:20:22+00:00

I am a big fan of rpg horror but have only come across a few good ones that I can truly say I have enjoyed in every aspect. Project Kat is extraordinary at packing so much bite into such limited amount of game play. I could even go back for a second play through [to get all achievements] and didn't find myself getting bored or restless. This is probably due to the fact I left the bottom left storage door untouched in my first play through and then circled back afterwards to pick the lock. I also replayed the game after inviting the three girls to join me in the ritual. After inviting them to your ""party"" they will follow you throughout the game, similar to the mechanics of corpse party except they are always present and never ""one"" with Kat. This expanded the dialogue ten fold and pretty much tripled the interaction and reaction box responses. Just a brilliant short story that unfolds in an incredibly interactive and thought provoking way. Could be approached as a mind invigorating weave of puzzles to unfurl or, if you're feeling more casual, you can approach it with an in and out easy approach. Versatile and layered.

[h2] Score: 8.5 / 10 [/h2]

I went into this expecting another forgettable RPG Maker horror game, but Project Kat hits different. It's got personality, player choice, and a main character who’s just the right mix of smug and doomed. The art style? Adorable and creepy in equal measure. The little animations, the subtle jokes, the atmosphere — it’s all made with the kind of love most games can’t fake. I’d almost call it charming, if I hadn’t sworn never to use that word in a review.

It’s spooky without being cheap, and the choices genuinely affect how things unfold — even if they all seem to lead to the same deliciously ominous end. My only real complaint is that it’s over just when things start to get juicy. But hey, it’s free. And it’s technically a prologue. So I won’t deduct too many points for that.

A.B.O verdict: Project Kat is short, stylish, and way smarter than it looks. Just don’t expect closure — it’s here to open a door, not close one. And even if, you'll nose nothing by trying a free game.

As a prologue, it does its job exceptionally well: it introduces the world, teases larger storylines, and leaves you wanting more. I’m genuinely excited for the full Paper Lily experience.

However, the choices leading to them are noticeably significant. 
The majority of smaller choices really only affect insignificant elements, like some different text or very short encounters that don't channel to a different result.

All said, those encounters are still fun to experience, and there are numerous fun little elements.

Maybe it's only introductory to the main game where small choices do matter.

I played it [i] after [/i] playing Paper Lily: Chapter 1 because I'm not the brightest, but there doesn't seem to be a downside to it. Both games are amazing, this one is just much faster and much more intuitive than the Paper Lily game. 

Pros:
- The soundtracks are good, the music is well fit to the scenes, not irritating 
- The controls are good, too. It follows the generic RPG type of control system but works well and nothing feels necessarily irritating to press. 
- I like how many options you have within the game, some options leading you to different endings, but some just being little interactions that don't necessarily count towards the story but are your own way of doing things. I love the emphasis at the beginning that there is *always* another way of doing something!
- The art is amazing, I said this for Paper Lily and it holds true for this too. Both games are very well polished, run amazing and I just can't believe that either or both are free!

Cons:
- The puzzles aren't inherently as hard as Paper Lily. In some cases this is good, the use of objects that you pick up makes sense, you can figure out the ""secret"" interactions yourself. However, I feel like the game was a bit too straightforward i.e. all routes and achievements were done without the need to consult a guide. 
- It's surprisingly short, and the True Ending yet again just feels lacklustre like Paper Lily. The game, story progression, all the ins and outs of the game are so good but both True Endings just feel so... meh

It's actually made in Godot, which really confused me at first. But despite imitating RPGM, it plays well—at least for a demo.

The story is similar to Corpse Party (I should replay that sometime). Our heroine, Kat, decides to perform a ritual at school since she's really interested in them. She gathers the necessary items, weird things start happening, and she must decide whether to go through with the ritual or not... (Before that, something important happens, but I won’t spoil it. I'll just say it’s actually a well-written section.)

Gameplay wise, it's very similar to other RPGM horror-puzzle games. You gather items, use them in specific situations, and progress. You can complete tasks in different orders, which leads to multiple paths. While your choices do affect the endings, many of them ultimately lead to the same conclusion just with a different flavor. That’s not necessarily a bad thing. (Some of the endings were actually different from the *classic* **""you died the end""** type, which is great.)

Controls, art, and music are all in the same boat—they’re okay. Nothing really stands out, but nothing is bad either.

Using the Godot engine while incorporating RPGM-inspired gameplay has some potential. Since RPGM is a really limited engine, this could allow for more unique gameplay sections, which I hope to see in the future.

Overall, it's a great demo (I guess it is?). Since the game is free and short, I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys this kind of game.",76561199512066815,0,37,89,0,89,2025-03-09T21:27:19+00:00

As for the gameplay, you play as Kat, a student who sneaks into her school at night to perform a ritual.

Your mission is straightforward, help Kat collect the items needed for the ritual & perform it (or maybe not)

The game has multiple ending, so what you choose to do will affect the ending.

There are puzzles involved, but nothing too difficult.


The early part of the game does a great job hooking you in and making you curious what the game is really about.

The storyline maybe a bit predictable...
(Well, obviously you can guess what's going to happen when you perform a ritual at school, especially AT NIGHT)

But predictable doesnt mean it is boring.
I really enjoyed the game.
It does a good job of making the school seems unsettling & making you feel isolated at certain part.

I replayed the game many times just to get all the ending.

Overall Rating: ★★★★☆ (4.5/5)
Reviewed by: Horror game obsessed Femboy

As someone who played a good amount of horror and psychological horror games like cry of fear and such, I can confidently say its got a lot of polish in its design and story telling. You play the game as Kat a very nonchalant, smart, and kind of sarcastic girl with a fascination with the occult. Thankfully the game doesn't rely on jump scares to make it enjoyable, instead it builds the atmosphere through the music, pacing, and subtle story building. The consequences of your choices are shown to have an impact and matter even from the beginning of the game. 

Now lets go in depth.

Gameplay: The controls are simple and can be remapped as needed. The game has a unique system regarding interacting with models, etc. There are multiple paths and small choices that branch into different scenes; there is also really fun puzzles and mini games as well. It respects your time and need for adventure.

Art and Sound: The pixel art for me has always been a big selling point in games, Project Kats specifically is very clean and expressive, but what I really enjoyed was the sound design. Subtle ambiance, strategic silence and some music really added up to a great horror immersive experience. 

Narrative: What I love most about Project Kat is how it doesn't tell you everything. It lets your imagination fill all the empty spots which makes the horror feel much more immersive and scary. Kat's personality is well written she is courageous, confident, and curious.

Length: It is a very short game, only about 45 minutes of game play to an hour. 

Final thoughts: If you're into psychological horror that prioritizes immersive gameplay and respects your time over cheap gore—while adding in mystery and meaningful choices—then Project Kat is a must-play.",76561199819601893,0,1,267,0,267,2025-07-02T13:53:50+00:00

Both Project Kat and Paper Lily have the unique description that there are more than one way to solve a puzzle. 
I first didn't think much of it but while playing I realized how different it feels to traditional RPG Maker Horror games. You usually have one way to progress the story and one way to solve a puzzle. The extra work that has been put into these different solutions make a big difference for me personally. It fits your playstyle, gives the character a way to put yourself into their shoes. You can be a jerk or you can be honest. The choice is yours.

Project Kat - Paper Lily Prologue surprised me in all the right ways. On the surface, it looks like another pixel-art horror RPG with anime-inspired visuals and cryptic puzzles — but what sets it apart is the clarity of its tone, the confidence of its pacing, and the subtle ways it plays with genre expectations.

From the opening moments, Project Kat establishes a strong mood. The atmosphere is eerie but not overbearing, and it doesn’t rely on cheap jumpscares or gore to build tension. Instead, it leans into psychological unease — making you question the rules of its world, and slowly tightening the noose of dread as you push further into the unknown. And for a game that lasts less than an hour, that’s no small feat.

What impressed me most, though, is how polished and deliberate everything feels. The writing is sharp and understated. Kat — the protagonist — is refreshingly self-aware and skeptical, which adds a grounded edge to a story that could’ve easily drifted into cliché. The game manages to keep things ambiguous without being incoherent, letting players piece together fragments without holding their hand.

The puzzles are relatively simple but well-integrated. More importantly, the game offers multiple paths and solutions, hinting at a deeper branching narrative system that’s likely to be expanded in Paper Lily. That sense of hidden depth — that there’s more under the surface — is part of what makes the experience so compelling.

Visually, it nails the aesthetic. The spritework is expressive, the use of lighting is clever, and the limited animations are used at just the right moments to deliver impact. The music is sparse and moody, never drawing attention to itself but always reinforcing the unease.

If there’s any downside, it’s only that it ends too soon. But then again — it’s a prologue, not a full game. And as a teaser for what’s to come, it’s a triumph. It doesn’t just promise a great game in Paper Lily — it earns your curiosity and your trust with its craftsmanship.

Project Kat is a rare thing: a short indie horror experience that doesn’t feel derivative, doesn’t waste your time, and leaves you wanting more for the right reasons. If you’re a fan of narrative-driven horror with a psychological twist, this is absolutely worth your attention.",76561199375571709,0,145,54,0,54,2025-07-22T15:33:58+00:00

nah but for real though.
its drying up around my buttcheeks and its starting to itch.

The story had me invested straight away, the many small details and each interaction with the environment kept me invested in the game. The characters were nothing special in terms of design but their personalities were amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed the psychological horror this game had even though I don't usually play horror games. In multiple occasions, I was contemplating whether if i should alt f4 or not since the setting and music made me uneasy to the point I was looking over my shoulder to see if there was anyone watching me.

It's an advertisement for a product called ""Paper Lily"".  Paper Lily is an RPG construction kit asset flip slapped together badly, but never finished, the first chapter was dumped on Steam as another advert for the product which never eventuated.  Like all JRPG construction kit garbage, it's just a collection of complete cringe high school anime club dropout writing with assets ripped off from the construction kit, plus a few really crappy low quality 2D assets that may have been sourced elsewhere.

But this isn't completely relevant because this is not Paper Lily, it's just an advertisment for it, so it's not correct to try to review that completely distinct product.  We must instead review this for what it is... an advertisement.  If you enjoy advertisements, you can consume them for free on the web or on Youtube without needing to add them to your game library, download them, and then launch the advertising.  It's impossible in a general sense to recommend people should do that over playing real, full games on Steam, and that applies here with ""Project Kat - Paper Lily Prologue"" too.

The purpose of this advertisement, given there's no actual product to buy, is just to get you to give the ""developer"" EIGHT BUCKS to support them... wtf?  They want you to pay them $8 for this advertisement.  What a joke.  What weird beggarware.

This is only free in the same way that adverts on Youtube and banner ads in your browser are.  This is a game demo that's been dumped on Steam to advertise another Steam store page in the hopes of raking in some cash.  Just because advertisements are free, doesn't mean they're worth your time.

It's important to understand there's a formal process to create a demo/page for a game which hasn't been followed here:

https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/store/application/demos

While it might seem like an inocuous mistake, publishing demos and advertisements as if they are full games is misleading and in some ways harmful.  This advertisement is taking up marketing space and visibility that would be better made available to a developer that's done the right thing and created a full game.  Instead, that visibility is given over to a demo/advert that's been published incorrectly and is polluting the marketplace.

It's unclear if this mistake was made through incompetence or a deliberate intent to mislead gamers.  Often developers may choose to incorrectly publish demo/advertisements as separate games as a cheap way to bypass paying Valve for marketing presence on the Steam front page, which may seem clever to them, but it's harmful behaviour and it's not good for gamers.

Advertisements and incorrectly published demos don't add +1 to your game collector count, they aren't full games.  It's impossible for me to recommend this incorrectly published advertising spam to gamers, you deserve better than adverts.

Straight forward. Short 50min ish. A little problem solving but also easy. 8 endings. Nothing thought provoking. Not much humour. But it's scary and does the horror/creepy thing quite well ^^

I disagree with the ""psychological horror"" tag, but as straight-up horror this is a really good one!

I don't think it's worth hunting the 8 endings on your own, branches don't have much of a different journey and conclusions are more or less the same. I found 3 on my own before watching a conclusion video but then I'm not the patient 100% type ^^'

The game itself has very very basic gameplay controls and it's incredibly easy to play. As for the story - it's great! It went by so fast when I was completing the story, hunting for the other achievements etc. and since the title has Prologue in it's name, I really want to see the next chapters that Leef6010 will bring, hopefully soon!

In the game, we play as a female protagonist named Kat. She is in a school at night and disturbs the other 3 girls in the occult club's room cause she's preparing to do her own ritual. She's done many rituals before but none of them ever worked out. But she is recklessly doing another, hoping that a ritual will work out this time. Will it? Yes, unfortunately for her. She opened a one way gate to hell and the devil is laughing at her stupidity and mocking her. Pretty understandable. Will she escape and survive or die in despair? You'll find out once you play this game.


""Project Kat"" shows the stupidity of doing rituals and the consequences of that. The graphics of this game are really beautiful. As an RPG maker game, it's made in pixels but when we see the characters and pictures, we see how beautiful the art is. Also, the soundtrack is really stunning. It suits so freaking well and gives the perfect vibe to the game. The place where the story takes place is itself perfect. The abandoned dark school, with all those rooms, while doing a ritual.

With that said, I had fun with this! It's always fun when a game gives you many ways to solve a problem (such as you can use a lockpick when you find a hairpin or ask for a key for the theater door).

I see you are wondering whether this game is worth your time, well not to worry, you came to the right place! Below this i will separate this game and express my thoughts and feelings about them which in turn i hope helps give you a better insight to the game and give you more of  an idea of if you want to play!

Before we continue, please note that these views are mine alone and i realise others may differ so please have an open mind.

(NO SPOILERS)

First impressions - I came across this game whilst looking for something new and exciting that could provide me with enjoyment, the first thing i knew i liked about it was the art style! and once i saw the game style i had taken a quick glance at the rating by other players and hopped straight into it.

Art style - I have taken a liking of the art since i first saw the game and after playing, i can say it has not disappointed me at any point. Something about it just holds a simplistic look to it yet very well done. The characters are clear to be designed well and environments even more so. 

Characters - Something i must praise is that they put personality in the characters and it is clear they are realistically different from each other. Though they do not have a back-story to them, you feel as though you get to know them a little playing the game. As i said before the models for the characters are pristine, simplistic but well polished.


Controls - They are simple and easy for the player to use and in some parts make the game satisfying.


Story - It may not be the longest story, nor a complicated one, but you often find yourself feeling like you right there in the game with them while playing along. It is also somewhat realistic in the reasoning they have which is always nice, with what the story is based on also makes it that bit relatable. 

Simplicity- It is quite simplistic which i feel is a great attraction to this game, it isn't complicated and is fun and easy going.

Duration - It personally took me around an hour and a half (1 hour 30 minutes) though this does also include re-plays. In short, it is a quick easy game.

Achievements - Not too many to overwhelm the player and they are quite fun and easy meaning achievement hunters should take interest.

My experience - I, for one, can say i enjoyed playing the game and think of it often as it is a memorable time playing. At no point was i tired of the game, it kept my interest all the way through and i hold it as one of my best games i have had the pleasure of playing.

Re-play aspect - I myself have not re-played it fully as of yet but i have had a wish to at some point as i enjoyed my time and i think it will be a game that you can easily play again.

Thank You for giving me your time and in doing so i hope i was able to give you a little insight into the game and what you might get out of it, i hope i was able to help any doubts you may have had and if you do choose to play the game then feel free to let me know how you felt about your experience down below.",76561199203394298,0,6,94,0,94,2022-05-19T01:18:18+00:00

Well since the prologue is very short and sweet i won't spoil the story, there seems to be a super mysterious vibe to it. I just loved how polished the artwork is. Its a fairly new modernized pixel game and you can tell that instantly. Loved the alternative endings so far, strong occult and supernatural vibes, but i didnt feel that much scared playing the prologue except reading the ritual instructions. Not only there are alternative endings but alternative actions too which is quite unexpected, so the game is heading on the right direction. 

This game is worth being voice acted, it's super great and the CG character art isnt bad either. Characterization of the main protagonist is pretty good of what i saw, she is a skeptic and this is a horror game, so far so good. To the devs, all i can say is that the game is going in the right direction and I am expecting more interesting things.

After one play through I wasn't completely sold that Project Kat reached it's 'unconventional' goal, but after finding most endings (and to avoid spoiling) I can say I'm definitely onboard; if, after the first play through, you find yourself wondering what the game is trying to achieve, maybe give it another run through. The game is just as short as it is intriguing, but a single play through will unlikely provide you much to think about.

This game surprised me a lot. The graphics together with the background noises and music simply harmonized, so that sometimes you really got goose bumps in front of the pc. Although a short game of about an hour is very worthwhile to have played it once. What took some getting used to are the controls, but luckily you can change it in the settings. The puzzles were feasible even if you partly pondered something. Since it's just the prologue, I can hardly wait for Chapter 1. That's all and have a great day. Have fun playing <3",76561198089612262,160,109,69,0,69,2022-01-09T19:21:53+00:00

The horror is more suble and the game is much more about exploration and finding the different endings than I thought. When I realized that you can influence the story quiet a bit and have different outcomes, I was motivated to find them. Some pathes are obvious while other a pretty well hidden. 

Probably one of the best free single player games on steam.

I really enjoyed the game, the slightly creepy atmosphere and the cute girls are one of my favourite pairings.
You have the opportunity to make your own decisions and think about what object can be useful for a given situation, the game doesn't completely guide you, but it gives you clues as to what you need to do to move forward.
My first run took about an hour, but to get all the achievements I did several.
I love the ability to save whenever you want and to have several save slots so you can load a precise save, although this was a short game so 3 slots were more than enough, but in the full game I'd like to have more than 3 slots available.
it was very interesting because i had to reason about my actions and not try random things, and then the game held that constant slight anxiety that completed the atmosphere, i really enjoyed the whole game, the gameplay, the choice of style and the designs, and i can't wait for the full game to come out.

If you are looking for a short game with a short but interesting story and some horror, I highly recommend this game

This game is truly something else, there were tons of Options some mattered and others were pointless but that was one of my favorite things, all the Actions and Option pointless or not really contributed to world building and fed Imagination. Closing and Opening the window has no impact on the story but it made the world feel all the more real. Another part I enjoyed was all the little secrets and alternate paths, they weren't too hard to find but were just hard enough to make me think. I am looking forward to the next chapters as they release and would be more than happy to Pay for the finished product. Anyone interested in a good game with a captivating story and solid mechanics this game is for you, 10/10.",76561198386264630,283,5,206,0,126,2023-11-04T06:21:18+00:00

Though, I feel like some of the endings were a bit too specific to achieve. Other than though its really fun and looks very nice - the art style and overall design are both really good. Plus, Kat is quite the interesting character and I'd love to see more of her in the full game.

There aren't things that jump right at you like a jumpscare but the things that appear from time to time is just enough to send my spine tingling. They played around with the audio as well to give the extra suspense. Puzzles weren't that hard but I'm guessing these will in difficulty in the full game. With all that said, I can't wait for the full game!

tl;dr
• scary with no jumpscare
• easy puzzles
• can't wait for the full game :D",76561198256661792,267,24,189,0,189,2021-10-24T05:36:19+00:00

It gives me a ton of Kult:Divinity Lost vibes and that in itself is awesome. Sure the anime schoolgirl aesthetics might turn some off (and others on) but in the background there is a genuinely good atmospheric exploration game here and I truly recommend it as a short yet enjoyable experience on the occult side of things!

10/10 Would open the gateway again!",76561197989766649,0,369,118,0,118,2021-11-25T17:50:40+00:00

It made me feel eerie and second guess if I was home alone, exactly what it should be doing, great mood setting!

The beginning was upbeat and the achievement puzzling took me a minute to figure out which was nice, making me have to play through more than once to see the different ending. All in all i really liked this and will be looking for more short multi-layered games similar in the future! 

8/10 - could do with a couple more puzzles",76561198274235816,121,10,101,0,101,2022-09-14T19:58:36+00:00

I'm here mainly for the lore and I seriously can't wait for more. The thing I love the most about this game is probably the story/writing, it's just so well thought out. But I also greatly enjoy the gameplay and the spooky moments!
