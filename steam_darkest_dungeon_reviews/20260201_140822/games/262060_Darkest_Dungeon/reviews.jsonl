I'm kind of nearly 10 years too late (Oh my fuck-ing god it's been almost ten years jesus christ) but since the Autumn Sale is here a lot of people may be checking this game out so I need to pump out the propaganda.\n\nI'll start with a brief overview of the pros and cons of the game for those who just want a quick review, and then go into detail afterwards. \n\nPros:\n\n-Phenomenal Turn-Based Gameplay. Simple but so damn good.\n\n-Incredible Art Direction and Character Design. Hauntingly beautiful.\n\n-Amazing Atmosphere, and Narration. Seriously...Wayne June's performance elevates this game to another level.\n\n-Challenging yet Rewarding. Loot is always exciting to find and earn.\n\n-Stress Concept is Unique and Helps it Stand Out\n\n-Perfect Music. Ambiance and Combat themes capture what they need to amazingly.\n\n-Great Modding Scene....if you ignore the gooners (Seriously why for this game in specific is it so bad?)\n\nCons:\n\n-Difficulty Can Be A Turnoff. Easier difficulty modes exist, but characters WILL die in this game. \n\n-Critical Hits are Punishing. They feel good to pull off, but enemy crits can erase a heavily invested character.\n\n-Idk man I'm struggling to come up with any uhhhh stress act outs are kind of annoying and the crimson curse can be too ig\n\nNow for the detailed review.  Where to even begin? The game-play is multifaceted yet easy to understand. This game is called a Rouge-like...but I don't think that's entirely accurate. Sure, dungeons are randomized but your heroes retain their upgrades, trinkets and skills. Progression is much more permanent in this game, with your dungeon delving allowing the estate to grow and grant you new bonuses, shops and better heroes for the future challenges. The game-play loop in very simple terms is to expand your estate and set out on ever more dangerous expeditions with your heroes in order to eventually take on The Darkest Dungeon.\n\nSpeaking of, let's talk heroes. There are several different classes in this game- each sporting 8 unique skills. The characters excel in different positions but can be played in many different ways. The back-line healer? Yeah, she can beat the shit out of people in the front ranks too. It makes understanding each one very rewarding and fun. The skills themselves are easy to understand but can also expand into many complex and powerful setups and strategies. Want a team that stacks DoT? Maybe on that applies a mark to one enemy and guns it down? There's a lot of variation here. Your party is still human, though, and are vulnerable to the stress of the expedition.\n\nThis game's big calling card is the stress system. It's extremely memorable, and much simpler to understand than it sounds. In short, you can just consider it as a second health-bar with lower stakes. Certain attacks will deal stress damage, which causes a hero's stress to increase. If it gets too high, they will face a resolve check. 75% of the time they will fall into madness, and gain a random affliction. These afflictions can make characters act out against your commands and even hurt their allies. It can admittedly be frustrating to deal with, so managing your stress is important. Many hero skills, trinkets and prioritization of killing stress-causing enemies can make this easier to deal with, thankfully. If a character's stress bar fills out again, they'll suffer a heart attack which can leave them only one hit away from death.\n\n25% of the time, however, your character will become virtuous during a resolve check. Unlike afflictions, these make your character much stronger and even de-stress the rest of your team and themselves. It's very satisfying to dread having a character reach a resolve check in a hard fight, only for them to emerge virtuous and end up saving the entire party. Careful, though, because this game is not afraid to remind you of just how mortal a man really is.\n\nIf you're as brain rotted and mentally ill as me, you may know what a Pokemon Nuzlocke is. The game works very similarly to that. if you're normal, then its simply just that characters die permanently. Your favorite Crusader or Leper can be killed forever- barring a very rare event which allows you to bring one character back. This creates real, palpable stakes to each adventure and allows you to develop attachment to your favorite digital freak. I love Darkest Dungeon 2 as well, but this one of the things this game just does better than it. For some, though, this may be a turnoff. Pouring investment and emotional favoritism into your Grave Robber only for her to die brutally to a monster that looks like a deflated testicle? Not for everyone, sadly.\n\nMoving onto the artistic side, this game is hauntingly beautiful in so many different ways. The art, music, voice-work and story are dark, grungy and desolate but are so enrapturing and sometimes even motivational. Sure, 90% of the game is about humanity's corruption and eventual inescapable demise...but god does it feel good to crit and enemy or kill a boss. Each victory feels earned and like one step has been made closer to the end of the corruption.\n\n This is in no small part helped by the phenomenal narration by Wayne June, who has sadly passed away. In this game, he plays the role of your ancestor and constantly drops lore of the world and comments about your campaign. It sets the mood so perfectly and even bleeds into the game-play. This game has crunch to it- scoring a critical hit makes the game zoom in, and sparks a powerful voice line from your ancestor. Even non-critical hits will have voice lines that make the moment feel powerful and memorable. I think it's at its best when your character's stress breaks- only for them to remain resolute and virtuous. Hearing the narrator cry \"Many fall in the face of chaos, but not this one. Not today!\" as your beloved little gremlin Plague Doctor scores back after back crit? Yeah, this is cocaine for pathetic white boys like me.\n\nThe cons really are hard to pinpoint for me. Yes, the challenge can be frustrating. A badly timed crit can wipe an entire party of invested heroes and you'll want to just shut off the PC right there. It's always worth trying again, though, because as desolate as the game may feel sometimes, there are always more heroes waiting in the stagecoach. There is always hope of rising back up from the ashes and using the estate you've built to raise a new army and take vengeance for your fallen friends. \n\nThe odds are stacked against you, and the game wants you to feel the crushing burden of failure. The game may not be for you and that's okay. If you're willing, though, then there's always a path forward. This game is one of the best uses of video games as a medium to create art I've ever seen. Because you aren't just being told to feel despair, you're actively experiencing it. You don't have to look for the meaning, because it's what you make of it. You'll fall, and you will rise up again. The message of the game is hope- to keep trying no matter how many heroes die or how many expeditions result in disaster, because eventually you will succeed...\n\nagainst The Darkest Dungeon.\n\n10/10", "author_steamid": "76561198400652573", "author_num_games_owned": 29, "author_num_reviews": 1, "author_playtime_forever": 19905, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 19905, "author_last_played": "2025-08-10T07:04:43+00:00"}

It's meant to frustrate you and challenge you to do better. Lots of people don't find joy in that sort of challenge for a video game.\n\nYour characters arrive, grind, expire or are in dire need of respite. The story is a nice setup but quickly gets lost in the grind. My god, are you going to grind in this game. Even updating your Stage Coach to bring in more characters at higher levels will do little to stop the never ending need to grind up characters because of the games systems. Whether it by dying to stress or bad rolls. The non-character mechanics(ex. Town Events, torch light, spawning of mini-bosses) in the game are nice and not only match the themes of dire times but also keep the player constantly managing more than just character gear. Leveling up things in your town home base was wildly helpful but nothing screamed over powered. There's a variety of characters and each has their own move set(with the exception of Arbelast and Musketeer, they're identical. Musketeer is a reskin and DLC that as of right now is free), gear, and 'trinkets'(items that go into one of two slots per character that can influence them. Generic or class-specific). The quirks your characters can get from the dungeon add even more to consider, or to cure, anytime they delve and get stressed out. The narration is nice even if it starts to sound mocking after a certain amount of time with repetition, and the designs overall are very cool. \n\nThis game isn't perfectly balanced but it has so much going for it. I highly recommend it for players like me who enjoy being constantly challenged and beating the odds. If that's not your preference the game goes on sale often for under $5 USD, and even then I would recommend it for it's interesting mechanics for a short while. The DLC aren't anything I would rave about enough to mention in the base game review.\n\nGeneric tips and tricks for the interested;\n\n-Upgrade your Stage Coach early! It brings in new characters to use. The more slots it can show the better the odds of showing a class you want to use. Even better, there may be characters above level one so you don't invest as much time into a fresh prospect for the dungeons\n\n-Watch out for your Stress. It can drag a team down and be deadly, as you'll soon find out. How do you manage Stress besides the obvious of 'keep light nearby'? Kill enemies that begin in positions 3, and 4. They tend to have more Stress-based abilities\n\n-Stun is your most powerful friend, if you can get an enemy to have that condition\n\n-Trinkets are always underrated\n\n-The Cove is a deadly area on Stygian, just flat out avoid it", "author_steamid": "76561198400890911", "author_num_games_owned": 27, "author_num_reviews": 61, "author_playtime_forever": 14119, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 14119, "author_last_played": "2025-02-14T22:35:05+00:00"}

Not the gameplay or story progression but the animations are slow. If you want to really enjoy it you need faster darkest dungon mod, my fav is the one in nexus.\nIt saves hours in a campaign.\nThen the tutorial is slow, it becomes a chore every game.\nThen you need to complete 5-10 quests so you can unlock all the buildings and see heroes you want to use.\n\nEven then it's grind mostly. Need busts to upgrade buildings so you grind busts. Heroes need exp but missions suck so you grind them on same missions.\n\nTip: Instead of choosing a party from ground up for every mission you can implement a corps like system with solid teams.\nIt's easier to manage who gets to rest and who goes out with dedicated teams. It would be cool addition to have two parties out at the same time so they train outside your control or a way to train heroes without grinding.\n\nAnd game doesn't even respects when you do all that and raise a good hero.\nYour crusader who is sole survivor of a boss fight, trained and equipped well. Gets random crit, blighted in one round and then dies next round without ever getting a chance to be healed.\nIt would be reasonable if enemies were faster and it makes sense a legend can die to a bastard arrow but game calculating who takes turns is stupid. \nInstead of hero with 9+ speed the skeleton guy with 1 can take priority sometimes. There should be safeguards like if hero has more than double speed or 20 dodge and enemy's accuracy is debuffed, it should be certain they will miss or certain hero will get to strike first.\n\nAnd crits make no sense, enemy does a critical attack but it only hurts a little,but your heroes still get stressed out. \nYou can lose heroes in stupid ways like they refuse to eat a meal then they starve+death's door+ stressed from death's door+heart attack. And you can't do anything while it's happening. It's dumb.\n\nI think best feature is having quirks and trinkets to personalize your heroes, making them feel special.\nBut majority of quirks and trinkets are simply useless and clutter the game instead. Or have stupid debuffs that ruin them. Or simply too weak you don't even bother equipping one.\n\nHeroes getting quirks in town events-activities is a nice touch.\n\nGetting random quirks after quests however makes no sense. Virtous melee hero who survives deathly encounter earns a ranged trait for no reason.\nQuirk earning is a wasted potential.\n\nIt would be more enjoyable and it would feel more personal if traits were given by specific actions. Ex:\n-Guy who disarms traps more gets better at it.\n-Heroes that get afflicted constantly breaksdown completely needing proper treatment or goes \nfull psychotic.-And make it double edged sword, instead of simply stress debuff add +%25 \ndamage so he is unstable but stong making it a decision to treat that hero or not- \n-Guy who goes to warrens a lot should be warrens explorer. -This enables you to make region specific teams.-\n-Guy who lost a close friend to beast should be beast hater.\n\nHeroes that proved their worth or sole survivors of bossfights got things like \"Veteran's guilt\" or \"Local Legend\" that also effects other teammates making them calmer since they are adventuring with a guy that 1v1 an alligator. Or the guy who got afflicted and killed his own teammate making his future teammates stressed and more likely to turn paranoid.\nIt would feel more personal when you lose those heroes.\n\nQuirks and stress is what makes this game unique.\nThere should be a lot more quirks and diseases but important ones that make you care not -%5 melee damage. Imagine diseases spreading in barracks, or progressing worse and heroes getting more and more tired and needing treatment after you non stop used them for a month. \n\"Irrepressible\" should not be simply +%5 virtue chance. That makes it useless clutter, give him a good buff so we can rely on that hero not letting us down.\n \nYou don't feel anything when guy with no reaction to his own actions and randomly gained quirks die to a random reason you couldn't avoid.\n\nMost trinkets are mediocre while good ones have stupid debuffs that ruin them for no reason, earning that trinket is really challenging at first why not simply let player enjoy it?\n\nGrinding could be fun too but all the missions are essentially same:\n-Walk around the dungeon until you see enough rooms.\n-Activate 3 items (or gather 3 items from rooms) So walk around dungeon until you see enough rooms.\n-Skirmish/Cleanse Walk around dungeon and find room battles. Only difference is you can avoid wandering uselessly but that's only if you get to scout before, but scouting is chance based too. So same.\n-Scouting quest is literally walking around dungeon\n-Boss missions are slightly different since you avoid other rooms to hold on to your strength until boss.\nAlso why does bosses punish you for trying new tactics? Break the guy's stuff and they all get angrier and stronger. Or the game doesn't even let you break it. It's opposite of Fear&Hunger  instead of outsmarting the fight you get punished for not grinding until boss HP runs out. \n\nAnd all the dungeons feel the same, even though warrens are square shaped and weald is straightforward because of how missions are structured, you end up walking in a single line.\n\nThey could have added more variation, making dispersed paths that doesn't connect later on, with different rewards and risks so you can choose where to go or add VIP escort missions or survival ones where you fend off waves-Like farmstead-. Or ability to send another party to a lower level mission so they can grind themselves while acknowledging threat of losing them out of your control.\nLike add option to split party in half in scouting mission, so they scout faster but they need to be more self sustaining, and why not make speed more useful.\nOr make the layout more complex and give us ability to flank enemies in cleansing missions with a %100 chance to surprise them.\nOr attend to hamlet's needs to upgrade it instead of grinding busts.\n\nThings like buying campfires in short quests, using laudanum for stress healing, scouting for the room right next to you so you can plan ahead, arbalest/musketeer healing bleed, plague doctor having stronger battlefield medicine so she can be a weak healer, occultist having min 1 heal so he doesn't kill people randomly with bleed, campfire scouting skills being passive so you get the buff but don't spend time on it, meeting allies or another party you sent before etc. would make the game a lot more enjoyable.\n\nCamping skills take too much time and half of them are useless. Scouting should be given free at least for the room right next to you and all the skills related to scouting are so useless they are not worth the time and instead should be passive skill for equipping that hero. Having +%25 damage is better than idk a chance to scout ahead the corridor you will walk anyways because there is no other way.\n\nOnly differences are farmstead dlc and player's choice antiquarian rushes for money those feel nice but still you have to grind for the good missions and resources.\n\nIt's really, mostly grinding for a while so you can train your heroes faster and then they will reject your orders or die for some nonsense. It's a common thing for the game to unnecessarily restrict stuff so you grind more. Mods can help with that.\nThis game needs a remake with all of it's mods. Promise is good but you can't connect with heroes and their loses because heroes themselves don't care, they don't care if they accidently kill some of their own, or they don't care if they survive hell, they simply go to tavern have some drinks and get a random quirk.\nAlso Ancestor is cool but he talks too much for my taste.\n\nAlso even though nobody cares about it, I think it would be a nice touch if the same effect was seen at the same time. Like two heroes get blighted, instead of the horror+blight it would be comfier showing the blight once on two heroes and then the horror.", "author_steamid": "76561199825194648", "author_num_games_owned": 13, "author_num_reviews": 5, "author_playtime_forever": 11415, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 3773, "author_last_played": "2025-12-22T16:54:55+00:00"}

It takes forever to grind a hero to level 6, which is fine for the first part of the game, but becomes majorly tedious as you continue to play. The game forces characters to become unusable in lower tier missions, so you can't have an experienced hero help power level your plebs like you can in, say, XCOM. I understand what they were trying to do but it doesn't work. It makes the game an incredible grind fest.\n\nThe worst part of the game was the fact that when you finish a part of the main story dungeon, you can't use those four heroes in any subsequent story dungeon. The in universe reason for this is flimsy, but even if it wasn't this is a terrible piece of game design just meant to prolong the game and keep you grinding for no reason. \n\nWithin the dungeons, even travelling about seems to want to waste your time. Your party walks at a snail's pace, and scouting (which is essential) takes forever to resolve. Animations like curio interactions and trap disarming/triggers also take forever.\n\nBalance wise the game is also wack. Seems like the only real choice to make is to stack accuracy on all your heroes because high level enemies have such ridiculous dodge chances. Stuns are OP, consumables take no action and healers are only useful for topping you off so there's very little actual meaningful decisions to make during combat. \n\nDon't waste your time.

That being said, I can see why it wouldn't be the case for everyone else. I tend to keep my reviews from brief to slightly detailed on this platform, but [i]Darkest Dungeon[/i] is such a unique journey that truly resonated with me. I think it's probably for the best to lay out the full picture; especially if you've just got yourself the game, or are wondering if it would be wise buying it during a sale. So allow me to set the stage, in a structured way, to show you what truly is awaiting you in this wretched land. \n\n[i]\"You remember our venerable house, opulent and imperial...\"[/i]\n\n[b][u] The Good [/u][/b] \n\n[i]Presentation[/i]\nOne of the strongest point of [i]Darkest Dungeon[/i] from the very start, and a reason why it personally stuck so much with me, is how original and defined in [u]presentation & concept it truly is[/u]. The game is set in the Gothic era, but it also inspires itself a lot from Lovecraftian Horror and it fully takes advantage of it. From the first cinematic, the game engulfs you in mystery, and does it with very few words. To be honest, I sometime let it fully play when booting up the game after a long time, or when I feel like fully immersing myself in my ancestor's delirium. \n\n[u]The visuals[/u], like the title suggests, are very dim and unsaturated. The atmosphere is dark and unwelcoming, even the neighbouring Hamlet that's now decrepit is devoid-ed of any colours. Grotesque black strokes of ink shape the outlines of everything: The [i]UI[/i]s, the menus, the texts' typeface, the buildings, the various collectable objects and more so of every characters. That being said, that plays it to its favour as it fully ties in to the story and how atrocious the situation is: it sets the stage and raises the stake on how depressing the world truly has gone into.\n\nWhile we are talking graphics, the next logical thing would be to address the [u]monster and enemy design[/u]. To make fairly brief, they are nothing short of amazing and well thought-out. Many monsters have standard ghastly look as you begin : classic skeletons, to wild dogs and madmen. As you progress the game and ramp up in mission difficulties however, they get even more ghoulish. Bosses are the true stars in design though, and should be as they are centre-piece to the story and they all have a unique grotesque, Lovecraftian design to show it.       \n\nAs for [u]the music and overall sound design[/u], the tone is gloomy, sometime unnervingly silent while traversing the many dungeons' halls, other time thrilling when engaging in combat. My favourite piece however, is the [i]\"The Hamlet\"[/i], the track that plays when visiting the main hub - the Hamlet. I think that Stuart Chatwood, the composer, really did something special there. This track is very intriguing to me as it tethers between drops of hopeful and depressive tones. I think they've really nailed in creating a soothing yet unsettling atmosphere.\n\nThe jewel of sound design though, inevitably goes to [u]the narration of the game[/u], performed by talented and late [b]Wayne June[/b] (May he rest in peace), that is present throughout every player choice, every discovery and at every return to the Hamlet, after previous expeditions. Something about the cadence of the words and his deep gravelling voice just tie in perfectly with the writing, and it hitches the right spot in my psyche. I sometimes catch myself quoting him out loud during the day, or when playing other games. His overall performance like his character's nightmares was otherworldly and he is sorely missed.   \n\n[b][u] The more challenging [/u][/b] \n\n[i]\"And now the true test... hold fast, or expire?.\"[/i]\n\nThe gameplay loop on the surface is simple : \n\nRecruit heroes, gather them in an handcrafted party tailored to certain needs via each individual skills (Heroes that benefit from debuffs, status effects, against certain enemy type, etc), and level up their Resolve by exploring procedurely generated dungeons and vanquishing the evil and sometime bosses roaming within them. Gather, in a restrained inventory, loot throughout the expeditions such as gold to buy the various services the town offers like skill and arsenal upgrades, or other valuable trinkets and heirloom to upgrade town buildings; thus improving the efficiency of said services. Rinse and repeat until your roster is strong enough to face the Darkest Dungeon.\n\nThe real gripe with a lot of players, especially the new ones is [u]the learning curve and overall investment [/u] of time required to fully enjoy the game. Heroes that end up dying is a very punishing experience during the expeditions as it drastically lowers the chances of successful runs, and it can also set you back a lot in the beginning when resources are finite. A roster that does not perish instantly though can slowly succumb to stress, which adds in a ton of unwanted parameters, and can be the difference between victory and defeat. The real challenge then is to carefully avoid stressing your party during expeditions as it can lead to members skipping their turn, stressing other heroes or worse, succumbing to heart attacks. I've had my fair share of failed excursions from a single recruit that managed to raise panic in the entire party, leading to a full team wipe. Though this is hard at first, you definitely can and should learn from failure, i.e. what stresses your recruits and how to stop it. This accumulated experience makes each run smoother and all the more satisfying when victorious.\n\nSome will say that a game should be fully enjoyable from the get go, and I do respect this opinion, which is why I understand if these same people end up putting the game down for a while, if not forever. Truth be told, I had a previous 60 hour run that sat idle for a good year when I came back to the game. [i]Darkest Dungeon[/i] is a very complicated game to get into, even at standard difficulty. A good tip is to leave the wiki opened and gather as much information / strategies as possible. This will smooth out the experience.  \n\nMy recommendations : \n- Upgrade gears and skills first, as they improve your heroes' base stats, and make them deadlier and harder to hit in more difficult dungeons.\n- DO NOT activate the Crimson Court and Colour of Madness DLCs as they increase the game difficulty drastically in the beginning, since they implement various, deadlier monsters that can spawn in standard regions. \n- Start with the standard vanilla experience with maybe new hero class unlocked, and activate Districts and other DLCs as you progress and gain confidence.\n- Take your time, open the Wiki, seek resources\n- Most of all: have fun and be patient, be mindful, be prepared\n\n[h3]TL;DR:[/h3]  \n[i]Darkest Dungeon[/i] is a dark and excellent turned-based combat RPG, especially for those who'll be patient enough to learn its core principles and let the game open itself to them. Its presentation, visuals, music and overall atmosphere are uniquely ghoulish and adequate to the setting. The gameplay loop itself while sometime frustrating after losing a hero, failing missions or because of what seems to be random factors, is a perfect proof of a steep, and unforgiving learning curve; it also tie in perfectly with the setting of an unforgiving story. This is probably the most discouraging aspect of the game though, as it can sometimes be a heavy grind and is also why it could potentially be a bad choice for some. Though for those who are looking for a new kind of challenge, a lengthy investment, who'll want to spend it theory crafting and learning the many systems will find an intriguing story, a satisfying loop of scrounging dungeons, gathering resources and obliterating the monstrous opposition, and overall a uniquely phenomenal game.\n\n[i]\"Many fall in the face of chaos; but not this one, not today.\"[/i]", "author_steamid": "76561198058155699", "author_num_games_owned": 0, "author_num_reviews": 12, "author_playtime_forever": 11176, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 9897, "author_last_played": "2025-05-31T03:12:58+00:00"}

The visuals, story telling and atmosphere are amazing and truly deliver on a Victorian era cosmic horror story. The core idea is insanely fun and addicting, building up a team of adventurers to go back and slay the evil in your family's manor. Managing things like plagues, hunger and the ever necessary sanity/stress mechanic a Lovecraft game should have. Hero's get traits that buff/nerf them, builds can be diverse with classes being able to be built in support/tank/dps kinda ways. The modding community is also insanely healthy adding new classes, skins and mechanics into the game. However all this good does have an * attached to it so lets get into it. \n\nThis game is built to hate you, playing the game is a massive hate fest towards you. This stems from its largest issue RNG.\nWhile RNG isnt new to turn based rpgs its used way to much as a crutch in DD. To the point some fights feel less hard and more of a dice roll to see if you can win. Death spirals can occur from an unlucky crit by the enemy. A wandering boss can just appear and end a run. This is especially prevalent in the early game where losing a single hero can be extremely punishing. It tilts a bit too much in the \"unfair\" category where you are often left frustrated more than elated from the RNG. \nHowever when you reach late game it swings in the opposite direction. Meta builds can completely steamroll certain sections of the game. Sometimes RNG will kill one of your god heroes but you have built up such a force and resources its just a minor set back and annoyance.\n\nOver all I love DD despite its flaw of overusing RNG for difficulty. The game has a lot there and if you either can stomach the coin flips (or down load some mods to make it more fair) the game is extremely enjoyable and atmospheric.\nJust stay away from the DLCs", "author_steamid": "76561198059423971", "author_num_games_owned": 456, "author_num_reviews": 15, "author_playtime_forever": 3864, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 3717, "author_last_played": "2025-03-21T03:01:55+00:00"}

I think this is a pendulum swing that swung too far.\r\n\r\nOnce you get the knack of the game, it isn't so much that it's hard, but rather that it's tedious in a way that isn't fun. Your characters aren't characters really, they're resources to be expended for progression. The mechanics of the fights are extremely RNG dependent, so you have to look past the current dungeon and plan ahead. It leaves little room for strategy, and more like you're reacting to the RNG that occurs, which is always tilted against you.\r\n\r\n At first it's frustrating as hell, then you get used to it and it's just boring and kind of depressing. You don't feel like you have much control of anything because in order to get anywhere, you have to roll the die and hope your party doesn't self-sabotage itself too hard before you can finish out the dungeon. When you inevitably lose characters, or gamble your entire party and lose, then you have to spend time rerunning content to build new characters to flip the coin all over again.  \r\n\r\nThis game doesn't allow for the player to have much agency, the strategy is to stay patient and take the smartest risks you can, all of which are stacked against you, and don't get attached to any of your characters because eventually rng will claim them. \r\n\r\nIf you crave struggle for struggle's sake, or if you're an outright masochist who enjoys grinding, you might like this game. Maybe you just want to feel like you accomplished something but withstanding the punishment, so you can hold it over other people's heads or something if that's your thing.

It is very challenging and very difficult but sadly gets repetitive real quick and slow. You can mod it to make it faster and all.

I finished my first playthrough. I thought it would be cool to do some achievements to have some \"side missions\" going and have more fun. It made the game so boring and repetitive. I'm doing obnoxious things like trying to get RNG right in fights and hunt for bosses in endless DLC fights, die to trap, die to wilbur, die to this, kill a boss with half your party Virtue and other Afflicted... Even if I do it succesfully, it isn't fun or rewarding at ALL. They added all DLCs into the achievements making your base game achievements non-perfect and DLCs a must buy if you really care for having the trophy. They managed to make the base game fun and difficult but achievements non-rewarding and boring as hell at the same time. In games like Risk of Rain 2, you get some cool cosmetics for finishing the game on hardest difficulty or new equipments for doing tedious chores like pushing 100 crabs off the map.\n\nI would say 10/10 game if you asked me the first time I finished it. But every little animation being so slow and doing any sort of achievement and task rewards you with nothing that you can use ingame. Not even cosmetics or a display of mastery. And without mods, most animations are very long and walking across the map back and forth is a tediously slow task. Mods make the game much better than it is. You can also get cool custom skins for your characters. It reminded me of playing Bethesda games where most of them can't really be enjoyed without mods and I hate having to rely on mods.\n\n8/10.", "author_steamid": "76561198019620861", "author_num_games_owned": 299, "author_num_reviews": 50, "author_playtime_forever": 15345, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 15294, "author_last_played": "2025-09-24T19:54:10+00:00"}

With its gothic atmosphere, challenging mechanics, and deep storytelling, it offers players not just a game, but an experience. If you're looking for an adventure filled with dark themes, strategic depth, and psychological tension, this game will captivate you.\n\nA Visual Feast: A Dark Work of Art\nDarkest Dungeon’s gothic art style and bleak atmosphere pull you in from the very first moment. Every pixel seems meticulously crafted to convey the game’s hopeless and eerie world. Dark corridors, decaying castles, and spine-chilling dungeons create a constant sense of tension and curiosity. The narrator is a phenomenal element that completes this atmosphere—every sentence, every inflection injects the game’s soul directly into your veins.\n\nDeath and Madness: The Dance of Strategy and Psychology\nIn Darkest Dungeon, you’re not just fighting enemies—you’re also managing your characters’ mental health. Psychological elements like stress, fear, paranoia, and even heroism create a unique experience every time you play. Your characters battle not only physically but mentally as well, making this one of the game’s most distinctive features.\n\nThe combat system is a strategic delight. Every move and every ability must be used at the right moment. A single misstep can cost you your entire team. Discovering the synergy between your characters’ classes and abilities is incredibly rewarding. By experimenting with different combinations, you can craft your own strategies with each run.\n\nA Dark Legacy: Lost in the Depths of Story\nThe game tasks you with cleansing the decaying estate and dungeons left behind by a relative who bequeathed you a dark legacy. But this mission isn’t just a physical struggle—it’s an internal reckoning. Every expedition, every loss, pulls you deeper into the game’s dark world. The story isn’t spoon-fed; instead, it’s discovered piece by piece, keeping your curiosity constantly alive.\n\nDifficulty: Brutal but Fair\nDarkest Dungeon is definitely not an easy game. You’ll suffer losses, your characters will die, and sometimes all your progress will crumble in an instant. However, this very difficulty is what makes the game so compelling. Every success, every small victory is rewarded with a profound sense of satisfaction. If you enjoy challenging games, Darkest Dungeon will undoubtedly satisfy you.\n\nConclusion: Dive into the Darkness and Lose Yourself\nDarkest Dungeon is not just a game; it’s an experience. With its dark atmosphere, deep strategy, and psychological elements, it mesmerizes players. If you’re looking for a tough, thought-provoking game that keeps you constantly on edge, Darkest Dungeon is perfect for you. Playing this game is like embarking on an adventure.

I've actually played DD on Xbox long before actually getting it on steam, I don't know the hours off the top of my head but I've played it for months when first getting it due to my love for the style and voice acting and idea behind it and even almost beat it at one point before moving on to different games. \n\nWith that said thanks for the rewards even if the jester ones was meant to be demeaning or insulting, points are points and if you can't handle an opinion then that's on you.", "author_steamid": "76561199111920462", "author_num_games_owned": 0, "author_num_reviews": 1, "author_playtime_forever": 510, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 510, "author_last_played": "2025-07-08T05:33:36+00:00"}

Playing it is also one of the cruelest things you can do to yourself.\n\nAt the forefront of this game's many strengths is its tightly-knit concept and execution. Every element of the experience is interwoven with the game's central themes: we are mortal, to battle despair is an uphill battle, and there is never enough rations— nor morale— for us to come back the same, if at all. The game is drenched in an incredibly congruent atmosphere of despair and gloom that seeps from every orifice. The sound design, music, writing, gameplay- it all comes together seamlessly to form a methodical waltz with the reaper.\n\nThe central gameplay loop is a simple to pick up, incredibly difficult to master dance of positioning, resource management, risk assessment, with a healthy initial dose of trial and error. The learning curve doesn't drop you off the side of a cliff by any means, difficulty increases smoothly throughout the game and the true tests of patience are saved for much, much later. The combat mechanics are both simple enough to immediately intuit and complex enough to have players contemplating the best courses of action for genuine stretches of time even after learning everything there is to know about a given encounter.\n\nThe aforementioned strength of this game, its unrelenting consistency, shines through not only in the gameplay. You have likely heard its iconic narration at some point as an audio clip or elsewhere- and for good reason. The late Wayne June delivers an extensive set of unforgettable lines both poignant and sardonic for every scenario. All of the art is lovingly rendered in a gritty, hand-drawn gothic 'comic-esque' style that is immediately both memorable and effective. The score is harsh and tense, and blends both orchestra and ambiance while merging seamlessly with the sound design.\n\nThe UI of the game blends in perfectly with the style, and monster design is exceptional- striking atrocities whose visuals genuinely stuck with me. The bosses take this even further in the right direction. All of this is to say, every single damn aspect of this game comes together flawlessly to make an absolute masterclass of being relentlessly depressing, all while dangling slivers of hope overhead.\n\nThis game is not without its challenges- it does not hold any punches, and that is precisely why it is both great and terrible. Rarely have even horror games made me so nervous and frustrated as the Estate had at its nadir. There is a definitive level of randomness that can at times feel unfair- though this is largely able to be mitigated with careful planning, such knowledge often comes from failure. You cannot learn responsibility until you see the effects of your negligence.\n\nIt should be said that this game can be, at times, genuinely infuriating- which is absolutely a valid reason to pass on this game. It is not enough to preserve the flesh- you must constantly contend with your heroes' ever-rising levels of stress, threatening to unravel all your hard work in an instant. You will have to accommodate for disease, for negative quirks, and for sheer happenstance. I had to restart my save from the ground up to successfully finish the campaign and even then I struggled through the entire way. It is only by standing again after the fall that you will see this game through, so if you struggle with motivating yourself after being beaten down or dislike when games take things away from you this is certainly not up your alley. Of course, without such dire stakes the tension and dread I've waxed poetic about throughout this review would all but dissipate like a bad dream under the morning sun.\n\nIf you like horror (cosmic or gothic!), turn-based strategy, or difficult games you owe it to yourself to play this one.\nOverconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.", "author_steamid": "76561198111747782", "author_num_games_owned": 0, "author_num_reviews": 17, "author_playtime_forever": 16853, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 16137, "author_last_played": "2026-01-16T06:02:59+00:00"}

Is it fun? Yes, to a degree. The art style is great, music and basic gameplay is solid, and the eldritch lore is fun. However, this game is frustrating, it is hard, and it is usually very unfair. As frustrating as it is, the community is also a mixed bag. There are a lot of modders creating great mods, new characters, and all sorts of fun things that make the game so much more enjoyable and less of a grind. However, if you have anything to say negatively about the game, you'll also be met with \"get good\" and \"you're playing wrong\". \n\nIs Darkest Dungeon a great representation of what Red Hook Studios was going for with their vision? For sure. Is the game a FUN game, if you like grinding, randomized chance with your characters, and needless repetition and pointless limits to make the game longer, then also yes. You may be thinking, why is this a positive review then? Well, for all my criticism of the game, it is still good. I did beat the Darkest Dungeon, and I did have fun doing so at times. The game is a very unique and provides a lot to players that enjoy this type of game, although that isn't me persay. \n\nThe DLCs make the game worse but offer new gameplay mechanics that spice up the game and adds greater difficulty for the masochists who enjoy it. The base game is great and while there are better ways to speed up the grind, and I would recommend downloading mods to do just that, I can't help but say that there is a reason the community who loves this game is so fiercely loyal to it that any criticism is shut down. This game fills a unique niche that deserves to have this game, and if you find yourself to be a part of that then this is for sure a buy. For anyone else? Look into it, do your research, and if you end up wanting to give it a chance then get it on sale.

You can't play easier dungeons with a stronger hero, for the sake of passing weeks, or simply farm money and heirlooms - nope. You have to either recruiter new low level heroes or TRY to grind in more difficult dungeons, and that is where it starts to get slow, boring, and of course, unforgiving - heroes get worn out, too much, to the point where grinding resources becomes not optimal. And that was the \"easier\" mode. I will not try the \"normal\".\r\n\r\nAnd finally, without mods to revive fallen heroes faster, and to allow any hero in any dungeon level, I would never finish the game.\r\n\r\nIt is not my type of game, at least not at the current moment in life, with short time to dedicate to games, and with less energy to do repetitive tasks (in-game) with almost no rewards and with lots of frustrating outcomes - real life is already unforgiving and frustrating enough.

Hmm.\n\nI've spent a lot of time and energy with this game, trying to do what it asks of me: build up a roster of flawed but powerful heroes; acquire the trinkets and estate upgrades necessary to attack the dungeons; work my way through the bosses to the Darkest Dungeon to finally complete it. It's not easy and failure is expected, and I appreciate that in a game's design when it's up front. \n\nHowever, this is not a game that respects your time or a particularly large amount of freedom of choice. There are better hero classes than others, there are trinkets you'll never use despite them being Legendary, and there are fights that your party are completely over-tuned for yet you lose because of dungeon balance. It's the last problem, fundamentally, that I take issue with. \n\nIn the early and mid game it's possible to maintain heroes, the estate, and to progress without too much difficulty, although the game balance really fights you at each turn. It's not an enjoyable experience, and don't get me wrong, I like a challenge and I like having to made trade-offs. Darkest Dungeon's approach to this isn't fun though, certainly not beyond mid-game. It becomes a chore, a grind, and it feels like the higher level dungeons and monsters weren't tuned properly. The game goes from being challenging (with not much in the way of reward either) to being frustrating and incredibly disrespectful of your time invested.\n\nI could go on but to be honest, I don't want to.

However, it takes hours of gameplay and a lot of resource investment to build up a character.

I personally think it's just not enjoyable to play this way. Because of how time wasting mistakes are, it's a pretty bad idea to go into things like boss fights blind. Which really kills a lot of the magic of the game for me, it's not super reasonable to actually explore and be surprised by playing blind. You can, I have gone into fights, lost people or had to retreat and then take it on later.

It's not a bad game—I can see why people enjoy it—but it's just not my type of game. It’s been sitting in my library since 2021, but I always had other games I was more excited to play. I bought it because of many positive reviews. Honestly, the fact that only ~4% of players have finished it should’ve been a red flag for me.\n\nI’ve heard people praise the combat, but in the two hours I played, it felt like the same repetitive cycle of switching between different attacks. I know that different class abilities can complement each other, but I didn’t get far enough into the game to really explore that—and honestly, I don’t think it would change how I feel about the core gameplay. What makes the combat and the main gameplay “varied” are the random events you can’t control—and that’s just not the kind of gameplay I enjoy. \n\nI get that the core of the game is how you respond to unpredictable, often negative events and try to minimize the damage. I know losing heroes is part of the experience. But the idea of spending hours leveling up a character only to have them die just kills any motivation to play the game. I don’t see the appeal in games that deliberately try to make the experience miserable by artificially ramping up the difficulty. \n\nAlso, the lack of options to speed up or skip animations is a major downside for me. I don't want to watch the same animations over and over again.\n\n[i]And before anyone says, “You only played for 2 hours”—I’ve been gaming for 30 years. I know pretty quickly whether something clicks with me or not. I’m confident that even if I put in more hours in the game, it won't change a thing.

Hunger strikes randomly, independent of when party members have last eaten or when hunger has last struck. This mechanic is also not really explained. I only discovered it when I lost a party member to starvation despite them having eaten recently and having rations in my pack (but not enough for the full party to eat all at once). Even worse, members of your party can become \"full\" from eating too many rations and can no longer consume them to gain health. Despite this, they can still take damage from a hunger event. Terrible.\n\n2. You cannot bring heroes on missions that are a tier below them. I understand what the devs were going for here, but it unfortunately just does not work. It means that, as you level your roster, you may not have enough low level heroes to create a viable, or even complete, team for tier one quests. It also means spending way more time grinding out levels, rather than having your high level heroes help teach your lower level ones. It doesn't particularly matter, but the in-universe explanation is a bit flimsy, too. Thankfully, this is easily addressed with mods.\n\n3. The biggest issue with Darkest Dungeon is that Red Hook Studios simply has a poor understanding of numbers. As you progress through the game to more difficult missions, enemy speed, dodge, etc. quickly outpace your own to a point that, difficulty aside, it starts to make lots of game mechanics irrelevant. Dodge stats, for example, already don't make sense. Enemies with relatively low dodge stats of 10-15 still manage to dodge constantly, but during champion level missions, you regularly encounter enemies with 40+ dodge, meaning that you simply won't do much damage if you don't build specifically for accuracy, disregarding all other aspects of combat. If an enemy gets a 50% damage reduction but still has 50 HP, the player just has to spend 10 turns grinding down the enemies health. Making gold and other quest rewards that are needed for advancement scarce doesn't make them seem more precious, it just means you have to grind out way more missions without doing a whole lot in between or feeling like you've progressed.\n\n\nWhen Darkest Dungeon hits, it really does. The system it employs for positioning during fights is really cool and adds a new dimension of strategy to party planning and combat. I like the system for mental breaks. Characters in general are allowed to have so much depth and development, that I start to feel very attached to them. Unfortunately, getting to the fun bits of the game requires a massive grind that I'm trying to power through, but would not recommend to other players unless they are very much aware of this going into the game.", "author_steamid": "76561198054504636", "author_num_games_owned": 504, "author_num_reviews": 140, "author_playtime_forever": 3393, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 327, "author_playtime_at_review": 2047, "author_last_played": "2026-01-19T21:46:54+00:00"}

From the first click into the Ruins to the final boss confrontation, the game constantly challenges you to think, plan, and react — and rewarding you for doing so.\n\n🔹 Stress as a Core System\nUnlike most strategy games, Darkest Dungeon treats stress as a combat stat. It influences performance, triggers quirks, and creates dynamic personalities that change how your heroes behave. That means every fight isn’t just about HP — it’s about managing fear, trauma, and morale, making each decision feel weighty.\n\n🔹 Positioning & Tactics\nPositioning isn’t cosmetic — it dictates which skills can be used and how enemies will respond. Do you protect your squishier damage dealers up front? Do you shuffle mid‑battle to set up a powerful combo? Each placement choice directly impacts your strategy.\n\n🔹 Combat Depth\nAbilities aren’t just numbers — they have positioning requirements, cooldowns, and strategic uses that reward smart play. The turn‑based system feels fluid yet challenging, encouraging you to exploit enemy weaknesses, guard, stun, and outmaneuver your foes.\n\n🔹 Resource & Party Management\nCamps, provisions, and hamlet upgrades are not afterthoughts — they’re integral to success. Deciding when to camp, how much food to bring, what trinkets to equip, and who to send on which mission all require calculated planning. Poor logistics can be just as punishing as bad combat.\n\n🔹 Permadeath & Consequences\nCharacter losses aren’t merely setbacks — they reshape your roster and force you to adjust builds and tactics. This makes victories feel earned and losses deeply memorable. The constant threat of permanent consequence gives every expedition real stakes.\n\n🔹 Synergy & Build Variety\nWith dozens of heroes and myriad upgrades and trinkets, the combinations of builds are deep and satisfying. Finding the synergy between skills, quirks, and trinkets becomes a strategic puzzle that never stops rewarding experimentation.\n\nDarkest Dungeon’s mechanics turn stress, positioning, and resource decisions into a rich tactical tapestry. It’s demanding, smart, and deeply satisfying — a game that rewards strategy, adaptation, and mastery at every turn.\n\n10/10 — one of the richest, smartest tactical RPG experiences ever made.", "author_steamid": "76561197996361718", "author_num_games_owned": 1294, "author_num_reviews": 63, "author_playtime_forever": 1021, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 1021, "author_last_played": "2023-04-25T00:04:53+00:00"}

Managing stress, taking risks, and trying to keep your team alive makes every expedition feel tense and meaningful. Even when things go wrong, it feels like part of the story instead of just “bad luck.”\n\nThe voice acting is also a huge highlight. The narrator adds so much personality and atmosphere that it honestly makes the whole game more memorable.\n\nOverall, Darkest Dungeon is a super addictive strategy game with amazing style, great pacing, and real challenge.

I'm in quest 2 of 4 in the Darkest dungeon level, and can't seem to get the perfect party together to get it completed. I think it's on me for not having the perfect party (a plague doctor in there didn't work out like I thought), but having to be perfect turns me off a game. I've seen some folks suggest playing on radiant difficulty, not because it's easier but because there's less grind involved, and I would echo that suggestion if it's true.\n\nGetting to the end does start feeling like grind for it's own sake. Each of the final quests takes a party of lvl 6 fully upgraded members to have a good attempt. I've lost 4 parties to the darkest dungeon quests so far (1 complete and 3 fails). Someone likes me starts doing the math after a while. Assuming you get them fully upgraded from the coach, you still have to invest 44,000 gold into a party for them to be fully equipped and skilled and the runs to get them from lvl 3 to lvl 6. I'm effectively down 176,000 gold on darkest dungeon parties, and after you complete one of the final quests, that party won't go back in. It's worn me down.\n\nThe music's great.

The enemies and bosses are just as memorable.\n\nThe DLC are well worth playing, adding a great change of pace and meaningful new additions and mechanics; if you enjoy the base game, they’re close to essential.\n\nMy only real criticism is the late game.

However, the enemies often have a huge advantage and there are many mechanics that work against you including disease, lighting, insanity, and more. What little achievement you feel from conquering a dungeon is very quickly lost when you even lose a SINGLE party member as they are not only lost for good but you’ll have to retrain a whole new recruit if/when they appear.

If their stress is too high, they will refuse to listen to commands, interfere with your party, or even attack each other altogether. Then you need to spend your limited money to help them feel better. \n\nYour objective is to restore your hamlet to its previous glory as your uncle passes away and you inherit the land. You'll endure lovecraftian horrors and difficult enemies. If the fights aren't enough to frustrate you, consistent dungeon crawls where you will literally endure, back to back missed attacks from your party. \n\nMy advice, do not have a favorite hero, because if they die, they are dead, forever, all your resources put into them is gone when they die, aside from some equipment. You can easily replace them, all heroes in this game are rteplacable. \n\nEnjoy raging!", "author_steamid": "76561198150077729", "author_num_games_owned": 0, "author_num_reviews": 12, "author_playtime_forever": 1410, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 263, "author_playtime_at_review": 1015, "author_last_played": "2026-01-29T14:16:25+00:00"}

I'm not surprised that even after the release of the second game in this series, the first is still going strong and receiving updates.\n\n✅ Art style: Unique and reminiscent of dark Fantasy comics.\n✅ Replay Value: Impossibly good.\n✅ MTX: the only \"microtransactions\" in DD are well priced DLC that expand the game.\n✅ Difficulty: Punishing but flexible.\n✅ Sound Design: Excellent, both in music and SFX\n✅ Gameplay: The loop for this game is superb for the genre.\n\n(A note on MTX: the DLC for Butchers Circus and the Musketeer Character are FREE, thereby adding a free character type and Multiplayer free of charge post-release)\n\nHonestly I struggle to find anything bad to say about the game. I think my one criticism is that the difficulty is a bit crunchy. It wouldn't hurt to add some softer dungeons to get a run moving so it doesn't feel like you're fighting entropy itself when you first start the game lol.\n\nEven lower difficulties suffer from a harsh launch into delving. Regardless, that's my only true gripe with the game.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough.

Now 100 hours later I understand that this game is not some hero's journey where the game tries to appear challenging through spongy enemies and terrible dialogue. No, this game makes it ABUNDANTLY clear that the odds are stacked against you by ripping away your precious heroes permanently when it so feels. It does not matter how leveled they are or what gear you give them to improve, there is ALWAYS a chance that your heroes die. \r\n\r\nAlthough the challenge of this game is immense, I do find that it is fair. Yes the enemies hit very hard, but if you build your characters out properly, you can hit them back just as hard if not harder. For example, if there is an enemy that completely negates 80% of damage taken, some heroes have skills that fully punch right through that for full damage, every time. Darkest Dungeon very much rewards smart tactics (unless the random dice rolls don't land in your favor). \r\n\r\nDarkest Dungeon also focuses in on the concept of risk/reward. For anyone considering buying the game, there is a torch that you can keep lit, and it grants you a myriad of bonuses. It's presented as this beacon of hope for your heroes lore-wise. However, you do not have to keep this torch lit. If you let it go out, the fights get harder, which put your heroes in danger, but you also get significantly more rewards for doing so. \r\n\r\nThere is so much that this game has to offer, and I am honestly shocked that I had not heard of it before I bought it myself. I genuinely have not been challenged by a game this much since the first time I played Dark Souls. I love this game with all my heart.

I played the game in Stygian the hardest difficulty.\n\nI get that the point of this game and Stygian is to be the hardest possible it could be, but even the hardest difficulty must be fair. For example, I finished Metro Exodus Best Ending with Ranger Hardcore difficulty and it's a pretty balanced difficulty for me, since the enemies are greater in intelligence, but they still have the same limitations of the player.\n\nOn the other hand, Darkest Dungeon Stygian Difficulty just lazily buffed the enemies HP, buffed the enemies attack, and add 1 new simple feature which is death limits. No shame to the developer, but for a game that glazed itself to be the \"darkest\", it could at least try to be more creative in making the enemies harder instead of just increasing the enemies stats with no thoughts behind it.\n\nI was hoping for a more mental gymnastic game like Metro Exodus Ranger Hardcore, not just this silly RNG stuff.\n\nBefore any of you accuse me of not using any tactics, I used up every single tactics I could develop from what the game teaches you:\n1) I made sure my light levels at the highest level possible in every single battle.\n2) I made sure my team composition is as balanced and using their full personal preference as possible. Even if the team I got were fully RNG.\n3) I made sure all the items I bring for my adventure is sufficient and befit every single situation as if I'm Goblin Slayer. Even having trinkets based on my team composition.\n4) I made sure all my actions in battle are calculated.\n\nAfter using all of that, I've used up all of the skills I could find as a beginner of Darkest Dungeon, but an experienced player at challenging game in general. Yet, it's not enough and still comes down to pure luck.\n\nEven Fear & Hunger at least have the common sense of rewarding the players for having in-game knowledge of what to do. Maybe this game is just not for me, or maybe some of the negative steam reviews are right.\n\nAlthough, I can see why people would love this game.\nIf you are one of those people who love this game, congratulations, you found the right game for you.\n\nIf you are one of those people who don't like this game for certain reasons, that's fine, you could choose whether you want to complain about the game or not, but don't linger too long, and just move on to find something else for you.\n\nPersonally, I left this negative review, because I spent money to purchase this game, and I was left disappointed.\n\nIf you ask why I don't just check reviews and playthrough of this game instead of going in blind. It's because I love uncovering the game inside and out without any public opinions to deter my own judgement. After all, the best thing in life for me is seeing something for the first time, to feel and experience it for myself. For examples, Metro Exodus and Don't Escape: 4 Days to Survive pleasantly surprised me. However, it seems my luck had ran out with this game, which is pretty poetic considering that my main problem with this game is that it's luck-heavy.\n\nAnyhow, I hope whoever is reading this has a good day, and I'm sorry for leaving this negative review.", "author_steamid": "76561198869913594", "author_num_games_owned": 175, "author_num_reviews": 25, "author_playtime_forever": 356, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 356, "author_last_played": "2025-11-20T18:20:33+00:00"}

First off, the classes and combat are really well designed. I'm not a big Lovecraft fan, but the themes are extremely well done and fit the game amazingly well. The game studio's name \"Red Hook\" is actually a Lovecraft reference itself, so you know these guys are really passionate about the material.\n\nThe turn-based combat system is great. Character position matters. Abilities can only be used in certain positions making for lots of possible team compositions based on what classes you choose and what positions you put them in.  Positioning also creates a lot of frustrations though, since several enemies will move your characters around and surprise mechanics may completely shuffle your team out of order at the start of combat.  An S tier team comp when in an exact order can easily become an F tier team when shuffled at the start of combat, causing you to lose a few early turns to fix your order or continue with it sub-optimally.  It's important to consider that and have some flexibility in your team for when you inevitably get moved or shuffled around.\n\nThe game really punishes you for lack of game knowledge, which is why the game is most difficult at the start and when playing blind without guides.  All the bosses have a mechanic that you need to understand and build your team around.  Not being prepared for it will often cause things to go south pretty quickly.  Earlier difficulties are a little more forgiving though, so it's up to you to quickly formulate ideas for an optimal strategy and remember to bring a good set-up when you take on the more difficult variations of those bosses later.  \n\nMy biggest gripe with the game is just that there is a lot of repetition.  You'll enter the same dungeons, fight the same kinds of monsters, fight increasingly difficult variations of bosses and then eventually take on the darkest dungeon.  Your characters and teams will die as you learn through a bit of trial and error to develop your game knowledge.  That's all fine, but having to re-level characters again, going through the same minimally randomized dungeons, just starts to feel like too much of a grind after a while, and not always particularly fun.\n\nWith all that being said, I still enjoyed the game overall.

It can be brutal, but it’s also very satisfying when your strategy pays off.\n\nThere are also a bunch of cool mods on the Workshop, though it’s worth checking if they’re still up to date.

I thought about and I realized that it was a game I got on sale for like 3$. Even if I think the game design suffers a large fundamental flaw, I do like the game and enjoyed it. I just think its not the game for me. I like punishing games, but not when it all come down luck determining if you do well and skill is so limited that one turn can ruin everything. So I guess 5/10. Like the idea and enjoyed playing it, but don't think I want to keep playing it anymore, considering it would take forever to get back to where I was and can loose it all regardless of what I do.\n\nGame is really fun, and I have enjoyed a good bit for the very cheap price I got it. I am having to leave a bad review over its game structure. I understand if a game needs to be punishing for a challenge but it just gets so ridiculous at the later game that its annoying. First you get to level up your characters to prepare for future challenges, with lvl 6 being the highest difficulty and lvl for characters. Once you lvl a hero beyond lvl 2 and 4, you lock them out of the easier difficulties. So I had lvl 6 characters pile up while trying to complete the medium difficulty missions and it just turned into a grind. You get new people that can rarely start at lvl 3, but normally 0-2, then run easy missions that are kinda boring  once you've done them a lot until they have a chance at the side quest, often needing to cycle missions to reduce stress. Then you run the side quest, have an easy prelude then just the maximum bs against the boss. I used an event to bring my lvl 6 dream team against one of these, and I don't know how I was supposed to do it otherwise, it was one of those where a crit saved my party, despite feeling like I played it well. It was the hag and one of her few moves is incapacitate a hero and steal its life, every single time anyone takes a turn. I freed my heroes and pounded the hag, but she got everyone to half health then chained crits on two heroes. I decided to attack instead of heal and I got really lucky. The real issue I think is the high difficulties at 5&6. A lot of the early game bosses, just turn into common enemies. Lvl 6 heroes can handle them, but the sheer volume is insane. I admit I'm writing this review after loosing my dream team in an instant, but I think its inevitable no matter the situation, which is where I think punishing you goes too far, and it frustrating for a game where you need to commit so much to each hero. Like in dark souls, if you play well, you don't get punished, and I think that is where game developers miss often in good difficult games.\n\nI should have known that mission was doomed when I thought I'm safe unless a necromancer spawns and that happened right after I left the room I was in. I patched everyone up and had to deal with several more of the like, especially this sailor that deals massive stress damage and is tough and can be guarded by tanks. I had a full health squad with higher stress than I liked but I was pass halfway through the mission. One turn later, my lvl 6 healer was dead from every enemy attacking her sequentially. I retreated, to escape and used my last bonfire. The healer had the thing to prevents ambushes so I risked it. My plague doctor gets a heart attack cause he's sad at the bonfire and an ambush starts, another previous mini boss. I somehow escape that, then one by one everyone in my party dies of heart attacks. There isn't any good way to deal with stress, all you can do is have a character or two always spam low impact stress reduction actions instead of fighting and starting with 0 stress and bonfires, which I did. It was a lvl 5 mission, where most my heroes that have died passed similarly with no modifiers to make it harder. \n\nA lot of this is just I'm upset, but if I can loose everything in one turn, with deathblow protection and decent strategy, it turns into a game of intense extended rng. I'm not really building my characters, just giving them better rolls and hoping the enemies don't gang crit my entire team every single turn", "author_steamid": "76561198128320850", "author_num_games_owned": 0, "author_num_reviews": 40, "author_playtime_forever": 2435, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 2435, "author_last_played": "2025-09-07T23:29:31+00:00"}

I love the challenge that it brings as you progress further along into the story even though sometimes you can get really unlucky and lose some of your favorite heroes, but that's what makes the game so good. The game does a great job at creating a sense of peril when you get into a tough fight, sometimes you are forced to abandon a quest because of fights not going your way, or running into a boss fight unexpectedly at a bad time like the collector, thing from the stars, etc. The best thing this game does is force you to make tough decisions, these decisions aren't just limited to the combat either. You have to make all kinds of decisions about whether you want to spend gold on your heroes by upgrading them or curing them of illness or getting rid of annoying quirks or whether you just want to dismiss them altogether to save yourself the hassle. You also get to decide what kind of build you want to have on your heroes and what kinds of comps you want to take into the differing dungeons.

The best part about this game is that when it goes on sale it is 10000000% worth the price because it's super cheap for one, but you also get a ridiculous amount of value for the amount of fun you have. Just a warning ahead of time for new players, you WILL get to a point in the game where RNG just goes the worst way possible for you. You will run into bosses at the worst possible time, you will get hit with multiple crits and lose a hero before you can heal them, you'll forget to change a skill out or forget to bring certain supplies, etc. The key to this game is patience and not getting too upset about things not going your way.

These things, combined with the sublime narration by Wayne June, really helps sell the premise of this game; Facing insurmountable odds, and dealing with the stress of it all. This game can be really frustrating; Permanent Hero Deaths, Random Crits, Quirks/Stress causing unforseen events. There's a lot of stuff that just keeps getting thrown against you over and over again. As such the game really rewards preparation and flexibility, as you'll need to plan well for the trials ahead, but also be able to adapt when things inevitably go wrong. While I enjoy this experience, I think the game as a whole stretches on for just a bit too long, which means that you start mixing in tedium with the frustrating moments, and it can make the lategame feel really painful. Despite that, I think it's worth a shot - You'll know whether or not its worth finishing the whole thing depending on how you feel after a few dungeons.", "author_steamid": "76561198131629406", "author_num_games_owned": 380, "author_num_reviews": 51, "author_playtime_forever": 14741, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 14741, "author_last_played": "2022-12-17T21:46:38+00:00"}

The sheer variety in character classes make it easy to pick the game up and play a different strategy every time. There's something for everyone who enjoys this genre in here, I find. It's definitely one of the funnest games I've played in a long time. Also, the soundtrack is absolutely fantastic, it fits the mood and atmsophere of the environments perfectly. The narrator has the most talented voice actor I've heard in quite a while. His unique inflection and interesting role as a character which narrates battles and navigation through the dungeons, but does not participate, makes him a fascinating and fun addition.

Making stress an actual game mechanic was a brilliant idea — it adds so much realism and emotional depth. You don’t just manage health bars; you manage the sanity and morale of your heroes. Every expedition feels like a psychological battle as much as a physical one.\n\nThe heroes themselves are fantastic — each class feels distinct and full of personality, with different abilities, strengths, and flaws that make team composition a thoughtful, strategic puzzle. The enemies are equally well-designed, both in visuals and in behavior, always keeping you on your toes.\n\nAnd I absolutely have to mention the game’s non-stop commentary — it’s perfectly executed. The narrator’s voice and lines add so much atmosphere and weight to everything you do. I genuinely enjoy every single comment; it makes every action feel significant and meaningful.\n\nThe levels and missions are varied and atmospheric, perfectly complemented by the game’s dark, gothic art style and haunting narration. Every small victory feels earned, and every defeat hits hard — but that’s what makes Darkest Dungeon so special.\n\nIt’s a brutal, beautiful experience — a masterpiece of strategy, atmosphere, and emotion.

Much of this comes in the form of your combat decision-making, which relies greatly on RNG. It makes use of damage ranges, dodge, accuracy, and so on. This aspect of the game is manageable, but certainly can be frustrating to new players or just certain enemies / across the game in general. \n\nI would also say that some mechanics do not feel great, such as the fact heroes refuse to return to the Darkest Dungeon. They do stop taking slots in your roster, however; so they aren't a detriment, but it did draw the game out. While mechanics such as these can be tedious, they are very thematic.\n\nUltimately, that is what I feel it comes down to. This game is incredibly thematic, with a focus on unique core systems. This game reinforces that you are not mind-controlling your heroes; you are commanding them. \n\nI love it.

The game oozes with charm, character, controlled chaos, it is an experience that wraps around you and sinks you deep into its black abyss. The beginning of the game is slow and towards the end it feels intentionally overly difficult to a \"I'm going to look up how to do this before I lose my entire Hamlet\" way.

With a lot of RNG-heavy RPGs, it's necessary to build around minimizing the detrimental effects of RNG; preparation's everything, and Darkest Dungeon makes no exception, ESPECIALLY with permadeath (and I've already had quite a few die despite not being that far in). Darkest Dungeon's going to toss diseases at your heroes, make them weirdly obsessed with corpses and thus making them get even MORE diseased and blighted, and will constantly stress them out to the point of one stressed hero snowballing into all four being stressed out. Despite all this, you can tip the balances in your favor just as much. Your heroes [i]will[/i] be thrown through the wringer as you learn this game, but this can still be mitigated through knowledge and preparation. I love this aspect of the game, but it's understandably not for everyone (neither does it make someone a \"bad\" player if they simply don't want to deal with this kind of challenge. Every game has its own varying challenges, after all, this is just Darkest Dungeon's).\n\nSome people also say to \"not get too attached to your heroes\", but I suggest you to do the opposite. Darkest Dungeon has managed to get me attached to my heroes in the most hype ways possible. In Week 7, before I started really understanding how the game works, I was about ready to just toss my heroes into expeditions for the sole purpose of getting as much money and materials as I could and backing out before my party wipes. I went into an expedition with a Houndmaster, Abomination, Jester, and a Man-at-Arms, none of which I particularly cared about. I managed to get my party to the very last fight of the expedition with my HM and MAA both at low health, while everyone but my ABOM being Afflicted (for reference, I didn't understand how necessary Stress Heals were). Both my MAA and HM died to Carrion Eaters, and when it was finally time for my ABOM's resolve to be tested, he became Virtuous for the first time and won the fight alongside the JES. I'm now determined to bring my ABOM to the Darkest Dungeon, or at least as far as I can towards it (I had to make the tough decision to dismiss my JES due to him having WAY too many negative quirks for me to salvage him.

My initial expectations were more on par with an easier Darkest Dungeon 2, so naturally this game was quite a shock. I dropped it after a grueling 30-40 hour first campaign where my progress felt stalled.\n\nThis game is neither a roguelike nor a roguelite. Not only is the intra-run progress made up of key mechanics, this game will punish you if you don't intimately learn and harmonize them with your strategy. At its core, I would call this a dungeon crawler: an RPG-lite dungeon crawling strategy with turn-based combat.\n\nI came back for my second campaign many years later and have been approaching gaming with a different mindset. Like we all do, I want to get through my backlog. But the goal is no longer to get through it; it's to enjoy the games while I naturally make progress. This mentality is what led me to ranking Darkest Dungeon amongst my favorite games ever and beating the campaign & Crimson Curse after another 80-90 hour campaign, with some help from ShuffleFM along the way. If completion / end game is the goal, know that this game is an absolute marathon. One more run can turn into yet another long night, and will, but the payoff from beating bosses, checking off Caretaker goals, and eventually clearing DD raids is on par with that of From Software bosses. Party management, that first seems like a chore, is the strategic backbone of a successful campaign. RnG will be your best friend and your worst enemy until you learn to effectively use trinkets and efficiently spend your money.\n\n\nMy only 2 suggestions: \n1. Enable the fast walking and any other fast mods that stick out to you, or you'll be around for longer than I was.\n2.

You can build teams around DOTs, stuns, stress heals, raw damage, or utility. Different comps work better in different areas, and experimenting is a big part of the fun (and pain).\r\n\r\nThe RNG is harsh but mostly fair. Misses and crits can make or break a run, but smart planning, positioning, and skill choices reduce the randomness. It rewards adaptation and punishes tunnel vision.\r\n\r\nNot only that, there’s trinkets that aren’t just stat boosts - they shape your strategy. Some are high risk/high reward. Others specialise what your heroes can do. Managing the collection is almost a game in itself.\r\n\r\nI grew up loving Lovecraft-type stories and the dread in this game absolutely tickles that love. The narration is iconic and the minimalistic storytelling leaves a heavy impression. The world feels oppressive, decayed and cursed - and that’s the point.\r\n\r\nGold, heirlooms, stress, food, torches - everything matters. The game constantly forces tough choices. Do you upgrade your Stage Coach or your Blacksmith? Do you push a bleeding hero one more room, or retreat and lose progress?\r\n\r\nIf you enjoy tough, strategic RPGs with meaningful consequences and a haunting art style, Darkest Dungeon is a must-play.

Set in a crumbling estate plagued by dark forces, the game tasks you with cleansing various regions while keeping your adventurers alive - physically and mentally.\r\n\r\nThe game's standout feature is its stress system. Characters don't just take damage - they suffer from fear, hopelessness, and irrational behaviour brought on by prolonged exposure to terror. Heroes can develop quirks and afflictions, lash out at teammates, or even die from a heart attack under extreme stress. This psychological element makes each decision weighty, adding tension to every turn and making success feel genuinely earned.\r\n\r\nCombat is turn-based and tactical, demanding smart team composition, positioning, and resource management. The odds are often against you, and failure is frequent—but that's part of the experience. Losing a veteran hero hurts, but it also reinforces Darkest Dungeon's core theme: victory has a cost.\r\n\r\nVisually, the game is stunning, with a gritty, hand-drawn art style that fits perfectly with its grim tone. Wayne June's narration adds a layer of foreboding that enhances the oppressive atmosphere.\r\n\r\nWhile its difficulty and grind may not appeal to everyone, those who embrace its merciless design will find Darkest Dungeon to be a deeply rewarding and unforgettable journey into despair.

MOST OF THE TIME.\n\nwhat DOES feel unfair are the huge endgame missions that don't let you retreat without losing a hero. these missions can absolutely destroy you if you dont have the correct trinkets, provisions, or heroes.. but you wont KNOW what a viable setup entails until you go in there, meaning youre almost guaranteed a loss and at least one hero death when you retreat (assuming nobody died in the dungeon).\nit feels like a time tax, where you have to waste your time in order to learn how to even TRY the mission. and then you know how to build a comp, but thats just for the ENEMIES, right? then you get to the boss and it requires an additional layer of setup, and if you didn't luck into the right comp, you lose a guy again.\n\nit really is just too much for me, to the point where i either have to spend hours and hours training new guys and farming more gold,, just to throw two teams into the grinder and have to train MORE guys for the final push to victory. at that point, i SHOULD turn to the wiki just to cut down on the time requirements, but that feels bad and defeats the whole experience of the game.\n\nthis is basically to say that i understand how you're SUPPOSED to progress through the final missions. but that time requirement is just too much for me personally.\n\nthe gameplay is good, scrapping together teams from whatever broken fools are available is fun. but you cant do that on the high level missions, you HAVE to optimize, and then its just a massive time suck- if you like learning and mastering games, its probably for you. but my motivation to do that can only go so far when the game keeps demanding more and more of my time at every turn.\n\ni've beaten nearly every boss. i understand the different characters' strengths and weaknesses. but i don't want to farm for all the required god-tier trinkets and train up two dozen different characters just so i can ATTEMPT the finale missions. the gameplay just isnt engaging enough for me to commit to that, so that's my breaking point. i'll play the game off and on with the steam deck, but its just too much of a time vampire to be a main game for me right now. i want to play other stuff.\n\nand that break MAY destroy my knowledge of the game and any motivation to continue, but i cant do anything about that. the game is just too long and too time consuming for me to try to beat at this point in my life.\n\nrecommended because its a good game that just lost me near the very end. maybe play on radiant difficulty if this review felt relatable", "author_steamid": "76561198125361958", "author_num_games_owned": 644, "author_num_reviews": 127, "author_playtime_forever": 3958, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 3958, "author_last_played": "2025-06-30T19:28:48+00:00"}

Darkest Dungeon is grueling, unforgivable, punishing, and most of all painful. All of those wrapped into a beautiful turn based combat system with stress and resource management, upgrades, trinkets. It's got a lot that brings to the table and brings it well.\n\nThese are things I love about this game.\n\n1. The Stress System: This system can be the make or break of a run, always being at the forefront of your mind much like your party's health bar. You have to manage your stress properly or find your heroes will start to crumble. Easily one of my favorite aspects of the game. It adds a human aspect to the characters and makes them more relatable creating that attachment more and more every run.\n\n2. The Combat: The combat is turn based style but at a unique camera angle, the entire game being from a side scroller perspective. This creates unique visuals which are stylized and very beautiful. However the combat can be incredibly frustrating with seemingly random misses based on a calculation that implies the miss should of never happened. Call it bad luck but the Vestal out here looking like shadowhart from Baldurs Gate, only good at healing. Miss Queen.\n\n3. The Story: I love Lovecraftian horror minus all of the old school racism, the atmosphere in this game is so thick you could cut it with a knife. I'm not going to go too far into the story and how I feel about it because it should realistically be appreciated completely blind.\n\n4. The Narrator: Rest In Peace Wayne June, what an incredible voice and display of beautiful word play. I know he didn't write the lines for his narration but he brings them to life. Even after hearing his lines repeated a hundred times, his voice so gripping and adds a layer of horror to the game. It would be half the experience without him.\n\nIt's really unfortunate this game never got a sequel.", "author_steamid": "76561198026217912", "author_num_games_owned": 0, "author_num_reviews": 34, "author_playtime_forever": 9718, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 8611, "author_last_played": "2025-06-29T09:36:06+00:00"}

You will probably restart your campaign several times before you can finish one run. I put this as a positive as I would much rather have a difficult game than a walking simulator. \n- Tactical layer does require a lot of experience on high difficulty (e.g. killing/healing phases). \n\nNeutral: \n- I am not to involved in the storyteller fan-club. But I am not against it either. It creates a decent atmosphere fitting the game. \n\nNegatives: \n- The game requires ahead knowledge to be played successfully. Unless you know ahead what the bosses can do, there is a very good chance you won't be able to finish the campaign. Having knowledge of the boss mechanics and events PRIOR to embarking is pretty mandatory in my opinion.

Despite some people putting out mods that are, shall we say, not to my tastes, the mod community is one of my favorite things about the game. Between skins, custom heroes to send on missions, gameplay tweaks, custom enemies, and whole added regions to explore, the modding community around Darkest Dungeon has breathed an incredible amount of extra life into a game that already had a lot going for it.\nI am sensitive myself, but I will say that it's not for the faintest of heart in that there's a lot of (cartoon) gore, dark topics touched on, and a bit of (cartoon) body horror that might be disturbing for some...

To but to be fair I gotta share both Pro's and cons\n\nPro's (My opinions) CW: Minor Spoilers.\n\n- Amazing Character Design and story. (I just think their all pretty)\n\n- Everyone is good! All of the characters feel good to play and have their places. Sure there is the \"Best\" characters to do a run with. But that changes depending on what you're doing. Going to fight the prophet? Probably not a great idea to bring leper. But Fighting Swine god or Countess? (if you do the Crimson Court DLC) Leper absolutely Slaps! Going to deal with Shambler or Thing from the stars? (Color of Madness DLC) Plague Doctor, and Flage are great at doing DOT that ignores their Damage resistance. You can also run Bounty hunter, Hound Master, and Occultist who are Great at reducing those damage resistances.\nPoint being all of the characters are good for different things.\n\n-Player Expression (Sort of? also kind of a continuation of the last pro.) There are several ways to deal with each situation. You're not required to play the game a specific way. Sure it makes it easier to run a million stuns and big chonk damage.  But it's not a requirement to do any specific build.\n\n-The combat system (I know Hot take) I love the combat system, I feel that it's actually surprisingly fair, While getting crit 3 times in a row sucks, I mean RNG. on the other hand sometimes you deal 3+ crits in a row on an attack that has a 5% chance to crit, There is no objectively \"correct\" way to do combat, again while stunning everything and bursting it down before it get's a turn is really strong and probably the \"best\" way to do combat when Stunning is an option, it doesn't make other routes \"incorrect\" I came up with several solutions to combats, some better than others, some more goofy than others. I intentionally built the goofiest team I could think of to beat the game with because I thought it would be funny. this wasn't on the easiest difficulty either.\n\n-Trinkets. I appreciate the trinkets adding another layer to the character building, both in story (Via Crimson Court Trinket quotes) and in team building, The fact that I can make Vestal the defacto healer into a front line tank with the right trinkets brings a whole nother level of enjoyment to team building for me.\n\n-Quirks. I love the fact that characters can develop certain quirks both negative and positive, it adds a layer to the personality of each character as well as another element to the team building, ie Let's not bring someone with Cove Phobe to the Cove, But someone with Eldritch hater? Oh yeah, it's all comin together.\n\nNow the Cons.\n\nCons\n\n-The game is slow, like really slow. Movement through dungeons, Interactions, Scouting, Combat animations, and so on, Are all pretty slow. I don't personally find this to be much of an issue especially considering this game came out about 9 years ago at the time of this review (05/26/2025) But I understand for some people it is. \n\n-Some encounters are INCREDIBLY annoying. I Absolutely hate The hag, and the Siren can be annoying if you don't know what you're doing. I cannot even begin to go into all the reasons why I absolutely hate the hag fights. but to summarize....STOP TAKING MY PARTY MEMBERS YOU STUPID F*** I SWEAR TO GOD JUST LET ME KILL YOU I HATE THIS STUPID MECHANIC I SWEAR TO GOD I'M TURNING YOU INTO A STEW AFTER THIS AND FEEDING YOU TO MY ABOMINATION!\n\n-The game is very....very Grindy, It takes so much time to get a character from 1-6 that I started just throwing characters into the DD just so that I could skip a week to try and find the right character at level 3 in the stage coach. When you start the game resources are so hard to come by that one bad run could ruin you financially and the only real way to recover is by grabbing some rando's from the stage coach and sending them into a dungeon and hoping they come back with something. Which if you get attached to all of your characters like I do, Sucks. \n\n-Butcher's Circus (Free PVP DLC) The Balance is kind of wack, really all I can say, Flage and Shield Breaker are kinda busted, but that makes sense since this is in fact made to be a solo PVE game. It could really use some balancing, but I doubt that'll happen anytime soon if ever considering the second game exists now.\n\nCommon Points. This is where I will address some of the common negative reviews on this game.\n\nI could some most of them up with \"Git Gud\" but that doesn't really help anyone.\n\n\"Fake difficulty, and meaningless upgrades that never actually make you feel any stronger. They could literally just remove the upgrades entirely and simply add new enemies as you progress and the game would be the exact same.\"\n\nI Greatly disagree with this point, I find myself Struggling to play earlier level dungeons Due to the lack of upgrades and Trinkets. It's not at all uncommon that I find myself Missing attacks on low level enemies with a low level party or having a bleed/Blight/Stun get Resisted, while against the same mob in later level dungeons I find this happens a lot less often, though I could see this being an issue if you aren't building Bleed/Blight/Stun Chance and Accuracy. \n\n\"Balance wise the game is also wack. Seems like the only real choice to make is to stack accuracy on all your heroes because high level enemies have such ridiculous dodge chances. Stuns are OP, consumables take no action and healers are only useful for topping you off so there's very little actual meaningful decisions to make during combat.\"\n\nI can understand this point, Accuracy is an important stat to consider but there are Many ways to deal with the issues of an enemy having a high dodge. Which by the way this review greatly exagurates the level of dodge the enemies get.\n\nThe Highest Dodge I could find that isn't a boss is the Madman which at max level have 40 dodge. Which if you have 100 ACC (Accuracy) Means you have a 60% chance to hit, And the madman much squishier than a lot of enemies. It kind of makes sens for this particular enemy to have this high of dodge. sure that's pretty high, but this mob in particular is pretty rare and this level of dodge is also not common.\n\nThe Highest level of dodge I could find on a boss was the Shrieker at 62, Which Yes is VERY HIGH, but is also Much squishier at this level than (Level 5 minimum) in terms of actual health than other bosses. With only 154 HP (185 on the hardest Difficulties) The only bosses with less health is the Hag with 135 (162 on Hardest difficulties) But also Steals one of your party members which requires you to split focus. \nAnd the Collector. My Arguement for the Collector is that summons 3 extra people who can protect it from damage and heal it. \n\nThis is also not including the fact that your characters will have anywhere between 20-50 Dodge Unmodified at this level. and most of their accuracy will be over 100, meaning you'd have more of than a 60% chance to hit the madman. \n\n\"Tedious. Obscure instructions. Punishes experimentation.\" \n\nThis one makes sense but kind of depends on your definition of \"Punishment\" \nThe game tells you from the get go that characters can and will die, it's about making the best of a bad situation. The Whole point is that it sucks and it's hard and the odds are stacked against you. If that's not for you, That's Entirely Valid. \nThat doesn't make the game bad, nore do I believe it justifies a bad review. \n\nTL/DR: Game is Great, It has it's issues but the game is 9ish years old at time of review, what game doesn't have it's issues?

For example, the Robber's \"Close Shot\" ability is powerful, but it can only be cast in the front and will fall back one space after casting, which requires the player to carefully arrange the standing position of the team and the skill release order.\n\n· Character development and resource management: Players need to run small towns, recruit heroes, and manage resources as they explore dungeons. At the same time, they also deal with the stress and quirks of heroes to prevent them from falling apart or slipping.\n\n· Difficulty and challenge: the game is difficult, fault tolerance is low and there is some randomness. Players need to constantly try and adjust strategies to make progress in the dungeon.\n\n\nGame Features\n\n· Dark and depressing style: The art style of the game is dark and depressing, and the background follows a pessimistic line. This style complements the theme and atmosphere of the game, and creates a tense and mysterious game experience for players.\n\n· Unique pressure system: The game has a pressure system. Heroes will accumulate pressure during the process of fighting and exploration. When the pressure is too high, it may lead to collapse. This system adds complexity and realism to the game.\n\n· Rich character setting: Each character has a unique backstory and personality traits. Players can learn more about their characters' stories by completing their individual tasks.\n\n\nGaming experience\n\n· Immersion: The music and narration of the game create a tense atmosphere and enhance the player's sense of substitution.\n\n· Repeatability: The game has high repeatability, and players can constantly challenge the dungeon through different character combinations and strategies.\n\n· Learning curve: the game is difficult to get started, and it may take novice players some time to get familiar with the game mechanism.\n\n\nlimitation\n\n· Insufficient novice guidance: The novice guidance of the game is not perfect enough, which may confuse novice players.\n\n· Randomness affects the experience: The high randomness of the game may make some players feel that there is too much luck.\n\nOverall, Dark Dungeons is a deep and challenging game that attracts a lot of players with its unique gameplay and dark style.

Don't expect to constantly win, it's not about \"how\" or \"if\" you lose, it's about when, and making sure those \"whens\" are as few as possible. Any run can quickly go downhill even with the most prepared team just because of some bad luck.\n\nHowever, while this is true since, after all, it's the whole point of the game, it still does a fantastic job of making you understand why you lose and how you can overcome your losses. The game often reminds you through the ancestor that you should never approach a fight or a dungeon with overconfidence, you should always be as prudent as possible because the game WILL make you fall sooner or later.\n\nSo if your run ends with a team wipe (worst possible outcome), it's most of the time your fault, and the sooner you realize that, the sooner you understand how the game works and how to make the most out of its mechanics.\n\nTeam wipes come from overconfidence so if you ever suffer one ask yourself: \"What did i do wrong this run? Was it a poorly put together team? Not enough damage output? Scarse healing? Maybe i should have taken a safer path instead of trying to get more loot?\"\nYou can get really good at the game once you understand the heroes' synergies, their best position and combinations with different kinds of playstyles but most importantly their weaknesses and how to make sure their impact is minimized.\nIf an hero dies on you, always remember of what the ancestor often tells you and start considering leaving the run. It's always better to leave with some stress and little loot than to leave a run broke and with 3 more dead heroes. \n\nTalking about the heroes, they have some amazing design and playstiles allowing for a lot of creativity with teambuilding. It needs some time to get used to every hero's movesets, but once it clicks the only problem you can run into is bad luck. Just remember that bad team combinations are most of the time fatal. I don't want to talk about the heroes too much, you should see for yourself and find your own favourite combination.\n\nIf i had to make an actual criticism of the game would be its repetivity if you don't particularly like the gameplay since it's a very very grindy game and also the speed mechanic is a bit random and can feel unfair at times (basically every round start everybody gets a hidden roll based on their actual speed, meaning sometimes a monster with 6 speed can go first than an 8 speed hero and viceversa).\n\nOtherwise i think the game is a masterpiece especially for its time thanks to its innovative mechanics, even today, its super-unique artstyle, the hero design is fantastic and the enemy designs specifically are phenomenal in my opinion and the gameplay loop, while harsh at times, is really rewarding.\n\n\"Remind yourself that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.\": A not very loved local man\n\noh and you can get syphilis by touching a book!\n10/10", "author_steamid": "76561199111791093", "author_num_games_owned": 0, "author_num_reviews": 11, "author_playtime_forever": 9408, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 8637, "author_last_played": "2026-01-11T11:42:47+00:00"}

Lovecraft and sealed with a blood-soaked wax stamp. Imagine if Edgar Allan Poe, your middle school emo phase, and a sea of tentacles had a baby. That’s Darkest Dungeon.\r\n\r\nYou start with a happy little group of adventurers, all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. Fast forward five minutes: one’s paranoid, one’s abusive, one has a gambling addiction, and the last one is hugging the corner whispering “the abyss gazes back.” Classic team-building!\r\n\r\nTentacles? Oh, you bet.\r\nIf you don’t like tentacles, first of all: how dare you. Second: this game isn’t for you. There are more slimy appendages here than in a late-night anime forum. By week three in-game, you’ll start questioning if your real-life soup is trying to mind-control you.\r\n\r\nInspired by Lovecraft?\r\nAbsolutely. If you’ve read Lovecraft, you’ll recognize the vibes: unexplainable horrors, relentless dread, and vocabulary that makes you say “do I even speak English?” The narrator (voiced by Wayne June — a man whose voice could narrate my grocery list and still make me cry) basically reads excerpts from the Necronomicon while you watch your Crusader have a nervous breakdown because someone looked at him funny.\r\n\r\nMechanics?\r\nYour characters stress out over everything. They’re like Tamagotchis with PTSD. Step on a weird tile? Stress. Teammate coughs? Stress. Something squelches in the dark? Double stress. I’ve seen less drama in reality TV.\r\n\r\nAnd when they die — because they will die — the game just shrugs and tells you to “recruit more meat shields.” Heartwarming.\r\n\r\nFinal thoughts?\r\nDarkest Dungeon is a beautifully cruel game that teaches you life lessons like:\r\n\r\nNever open an ancient tome.\r\n\r\nTentacles are never friendly.\r\n\r\nTrust no one. Especially yourself.\r\n\r\nAnd for the love of sanity, bring a jester. You’ll need him more than therapy.\r\n\r\nIf you’re into atmospheric horror, tactical punishment, and existential dread with a side of calamari, you’ll love this game. Just... don’t get too attached to your party. Or your sanity. Or hope.\r\n\r\n", "author_steamid": "76561198197023937", "author_num_games_owned": 0, "author_num_reviews": 9, "author_playtime_forever": 5843, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 5274, "author_last_played": "2025-04-22T23:38:39+00:00"}

I always read the reviews of games before buying them, and it seemed like some people had conflicted oppinions about the game; how it's too grindy, the gameplay is slow, it's too hard etc, but I gave it a try anyway. I've been playing for the last 5 days nonestop, I LOVE this game, and let me tell you why I don't completely agree with every negative thing I said earlier:\n\n1) I don't mind the grinding at all. The game is literally about doing the same expeditions all over again, but the fact that the game is hard (so it's always a challenge), and that you can use different characters every time and even different builds for each character, I don't feel like it's that repetitive, and you'll find yourself going over the same missions by your own will, because you want to get a certain item, or because you want the money reward. So yeah, even though I believe the grinding might not be for everyone, just letting you know that for many people (maybe even yourself), it isn't an inconvenience in most cases.\n2) The game is not that slow, but if you have played other games like balatro and slay the spire, you're probably familiar with an option to increase the game's speed. Even though it is very helpfull and I believe they should implement it in this game as well, you can 100% enjoy it the way it is without it, so don't let that hold you up.\n3) The game is hard, yes it is, and some people may not like it, but if you're up for a challenge, this is the game for you.", "author_steamid": "76561198330630126", "author_num_games_owned": 0, "author_num_reviews": 8, "author_playtime_forever": 15554, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 5885, "author_last_played": "2026-01-02T12:57:39+00:00"}

That being said, I do have some gripes with the game. To give some context, I’m a player with limited time due to life commitments, so this game works well for me. It's nice to just have it running, pause, and come back to it when I can.\n\nWhat I can't quite wrap my head around (and honestly, find frustrating) is how RNG-heavy the game is, especially when you're thrown into events and late-game dungeons with no guidance and no way to escape without losing a character. Given the time it takes to level up your toons, gather trinkets, and figure out team synergies, this feels poorly thought out.

One wrong move, and your carefully built team can spiral into madness or be wiped out entirely. It’s punishing, but fair—every failure feels like a lesson learned.\n\nThe art style is stunning, with hand-drawn characters and environments that ooze gothic horror. The narrator’s voice is iconic, delivering lines that are equal parts dramatic and chilling. The soundtrack perfectly complements the mood, making every moment feel like a descent into hell.\n\nYes, it’s hard. Yes, it can be unforgiving. But that’s what makes Darkest Dungeon so rewarding. When you finally overcome a brutal boss or survive a harrowing dungeon, the sense of accomplishment is unmatched.\n\nIf you love strategy, horror, or just a game that doesn’t hold your hand, this is a must-play.

Everything from the setting, to the enemies, to the characters, to the music/sound effects, and the HEART, the SOUL, the VOICE of this game: Wayne June. RIP, sir. \r\n\r\nThis game is as cold in its mercilessness as it is euphoric in the light of triumph. It is brutal, it demands so much from you: one mistake will cost you champions that you have put so much time and resources into, even bestowing a name onto! -- extinguishing as quickly as a candle's flame would to the passing wind. This game will beat you down and fling you to the bottom of the world, but the one thing that this game beats into you through your mounting failures is that you MUST learn from your mistakes. You MUST think carefully, or you will lose at least 7 additional hours to make up for your shortsightedness as I did. If you can't, you may as well just quit playing, \r\n\r\nThe best thing that I like about this game is its stress mechanic, which goes from 0 to 100 to 200. At 200 (or around 180), the champion suffers a heart attack and all their HP goes to 0, which may lead to them succumbing to a deathblow: they actually die. The reason why I bring it up is because once they hit the 100 mark, they make two choices: to fall to one of their vices (\"abusive\", \"hopeless\", \"fearful\", \"paranoid\", \"selfish\", \"irrational\", \"masochistic\") OR they can press on and showcase one of their virtues (\"stalwart\", \"courageous\", \"focused\", \"powerful\", vigorous\"). \r\n\r\nWhile we may never encounter otherworldly beings or the horrible nature of \"cosmic truth\", this game almost subliminally asks you: \"when you are pushed to your so-called limit, will you fall prey to yourself and doom those around you or will stake your life for yourself and the people around you?\" \r\n\r\n", "author_steamid": "76561198197957202", "author_num_games_owned": 0, "author_num_reviews": 12, "author_playtime_forever": 3247, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 3175, "author_last_played": "2025-02-16T08:16:02+00:00"}

Without the correct mindset you can't enjoy this game. This is not a game about defeating the horrors of the beyond one turn at a time. It's a game about all the bad, mental and physical, scars you get for adventuring. [spoiler]And to quote the narrator \"Scars can be healed; But never hidden\"[/spoiler]\n\nLast year i saw a huge discount on the game and was in the mood to torture myself, i thought. Oh, boy was that pain enjoyable. In this game you don't get attached to the heroes, you don't care if they go insane. Death is inevitable. All your hard work can be gone in a flash. But there are mountains of bodies to throw at the problem.\n\nBesides the awesome aesthetics, what kept me hooked on the game were the mechanics. The way that stats interact with buffs and debuffs. The way that every single quirk of a character counts. The way they are humanized, with all their flaws, yet so distant that they don't have to linger on your mind. How [b]stress[/b] plays such an important role in the game. How you have to care for your heroes not only physical, but also mental.\n\n[h3]I strongly believe that this game managed to strike the perfect balance between making you care about the people under your command and detaching yourself from them, by making sure this is not a hopeful setting to be in.[/h3]\n\n[br]\n\n[h1]UPDATE: After finishing the game[h1] (no spoilers)\n\nOH MY FUCKING GOD, IT WAS SUCH A CATHARTIC ENDING!!!

This is a game that you absolutely need to put many hours into, and it's quite easy for things to go horribly, horribly awry late (or early) into your run. You will most likely be restarting a few times. You WILL be on the edge of your seat on multiple occasions. Yelling at the screen in frustration inducing sometimes. You WILL get hammered by RNG more than once, and when you lose a character, you also lose their equipped gear, which can really hurt when they are max level with rare gear.

On the farmstead you are just endlessly fighting enemies and it limits the amount of team builds you can do, since you need to keep the stress low and heal constantly. Also why are the battle long buffs not lasting the entire battle, but just a single wave it makes them useless there and highly discouraged to be used, it also furthermore limits the amount of good builds.\nThe enemies are even worse, the most annoying is propably a minboss that has 80% damage resistant below 40% hp, removes DoT effects from itself and inflicts huge numbers of stress on the team is completly unfair as a semi random encounter, its the best to just avoid it all costs. Farmstead bosses that summon large amounts of enemies and also have self healing are also tortures especially cause you need high survival low damage builds to get to them. The Courtyard is a little bit better as it eases into main game progression better but the enemies are still a bit overtuned.\n\nOverall the base game is quite fun.

Meanwhile I can boost my dodge to over 70 and get hit nearly every attack. its really dumb, what is the point in buffing when it has no noticeable effect on performance.\nand lets talk about stress, this is a mind blowingly dumb mechanic, on a long mission you might have to do 30 fights, you can reach 100 stress easily in 4-5 enemy attacks. fighting 4 enemies a battle if you take 2 turns to wipe them out 5 attacks come out really quickly, and the AI is not dumb they will target your highest stress character with stress attacks. \nAt 100 stress you get a debuff that makes your characters stress their companions every turn and sometimes ignore orders. They will even refuse healing, they are going to die next turn but no, you aren't allowed to do anything about it. or worse they can literally commit suicide mid battle. \nThis causes your whole team to quickly stress out, so you have 4 guys all stressing all of their teammates every turn in an infinite death spiral. at 200 stress you just die.\nAs soon as any character hits 100 stress you have like one battle before the run is over. This is a mostly unavoidable mechanic, as there are basically no ways to reliably reduce stress. There are some abilities that reduce it, but it only really works in low level missions as in missions at your level or above the enemy just out DPS's you.  A good high level stress heal is for like 12 stress on a single unit, most stress attacks do 20, I have seen it hit as high as 45, and may hit many units. not to mention you take stress walking around. your entire team take stress every time you get critical hit(a very common occurance), but only half your team recovers stress when you crit. \nSo the only viable strategy is to kill the enemy as quickly as possible, when you out level them significantly this is possible, but at same level or higher it is not. Why you ask? because your level 6 team cannot reliably hit the lv 5 enemies, and even when they do hit them its at very low damage because enemies have armour. So you need to either debuff or blight or bleed them, which is fine except it takes time, and time means stress, which means death spiral.\nAnd then there is food, needing to eat is random(again why, what moron comes up with this?) so you can go an entire dungeon and use no food, or you can be forced to eat 4 times in 4 hallways concurrently. \nAnd even on missions you do perfectly, you can still get negative debuffs and illnesses at the end of mission, again why? \nWhat kind of moron dev punishes players for doing good?\nThe game does have a one more battle charm to it, but all of its mechanics were thought up by a braindead retard.", "author_steamid": "76561198039816721", "author_num_games_owned": 0, "author_num_reviews": 52, "author_playtime_forever": 3400, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 3400, "author_last_played": "2025-09-14T19:46:20+00:00"}

You are never safe and powerful enough, and regardless of how much grinding you do, you won’t have a pleasant experience in a dungeon of the same level as your team. Just when you think you’ve found a hero with useful positive traits, you’ll encounter a negative one that you absolutely don’t want. Just when you think the loot is finally worth entering the dungeon, you’ll notice it also brings negative stats. When you think you have enough gold for the desired upgrade, almost all of it will go into the next rationing for the dungeon, stress reduction, disease treatment etc... The game is certainly, alongside enjoyment, a real source of frustration. After about 20 hours of gameplay, I wasn’t able to complete 3 dungeons without taking a break. The game mentally wears you out, both because of the very detailed management and planning later on, and because of the insufficiently rewarding system. That’s not necessarily a bad thing; on the contrary, it’s very well implemented in this kind of a game. However, I was hoping that at least one out of every few dungeons would bring with it, if not more, at least an equal amount of positive and negative things. Random events will soon become a \"no click\" option because the chances for negative debuffs are much higher than the positive ones. If you want a game where you leave the dungeon with barely enough gold to survive the next one, with many diseases and stress you need to deal with as soon as possible, with loot that will only be useful for you by pure luck, with many upgrades that you’ll stare at for hours, wondering which to choose because of resource lack, etc, give the game a try. The inventory system is another brutally frustrating thing. You’ll often find yourself wondering what to leave behind because, alongside many torches, food, potions, keys, and shovels, you often won’t have enough space for full loot. The graphical design is immersive, and with excellent sound, it builds a great atmosphere. Don’t expect much from the story, nor from the characters, who are nothing more than expendable resources at your disposal. The game offers a lot, but it could have offered more and made the game harder with better mechanics, not through lack of resources, bad loot, and constant battles with diseases and negative effects, but through better AI and stronger opponents.

It is a game as much about the toll of psychological trauma as it is about strategic combat, and it wears its Lovecraftian inspiration like a badge of honor. From its haunting narration to its distinctive hand-drawn art style, Darkest Dungeon delivers an unforgettable descent into madness—both literally and figuratively—for players brave (or foolish) enough to explore its depths.\n\nAt its core, Darkest Dungeon is a dungeon-crawling experience driven by high-stakes risk-reward mechanics. Players inherit a decaying estate from a deranged ancestor and must recruit, manage, and lead a group of flawed heroes into procedurally generated dungeons to combat horrors both monstrous and mental. However, unlike many other games in the genre, Darkest Dungeon does not romanticize the idea of heroism. Characters suffer. They panic, falter, become afflicted with madness, or even abandon the party mid-fight. Stress plays a central mechanical role, as adventurers accumulate psychological strain through both combat and environmental factors. This system adds a nuanced layer of management, requiring the player to not only monitor health and resources but also the slowly unraveling minds of their party members.\n\nCombat in Darkest Dungeon is turn-based, positionally driven, and surprisingly deep. Each class has unique skills that function differently based on where the character stands in the formation and where the enemy is located. This emphasis on positioning turns every encounter into a delicate dance, especially when a single death or movement-disrupting ability can completely upend a strategy. The roster of classes, from the stalwart Crusader to the plague-slinging Plague Doctor, is diverse and rich with synergy potential, but the game’s ruthless difficulty ensures that even the best-prepared teams can be wiped out in an instant. Permanent death reinforces the stakes, and every venture into the dark feels like a legitimate gamble.\n\nWhat sets Darkest Dungeon apart is not just its mechanics, but its atmosphere. The art direction is striking—an amalgamation of grim comic book aesthetics and oppressive color palettes that reinforce the game's heavy tone. The sound design is equally memorable. Wayne June’s gravelly narration, filled with foreboding warnings and poetic despair, becomes a near-mythic presence throughout the game. His commentary reacts dynamically to your actions, lending weight to every success and especially to every failure. The soundtrack, composed by Stuart Chatwood, complements the game perfectly, ebbing and flowing with dread, melancholy, and occasional triumph. Together, these elements make Darkest Dungeon not just a game, but a mood, a slow-building pressure cooker of tension and ruin.\n\nThe metagame of managing the Hamlet—the player’s home base—is a vital counterbalance to the chaos of dungeon expeditions. It offers various facilities to reduce stress, cure diseases, treat quirks, and upgrade equipment. The loop of recruiting new heroes, equipping them, and cycling them through missions while trying to preserve the sanity of your best units creates a compelling rhythm. However, success is hard-won. Resources are limited, progress is slow, and the game is unafraid to punish overconfidence. Even after dozens of hours, the game retains its challenge and mystery, especially when tackling the endgame dungeons or attempting to complete the infamous Darkest Dungeon itself—a place where even high-level teams may not return.\n\nIt's worth mentioning that Darkest Dungeon is not a game for everyone. Its brutal difficulty, deliberate pacing, and psychologically taxing mechanics can feel overwhelming or even unfair. RNG plays a significant role, and the game often embraces suffering as a mechanic rather than an obstacle to overcome. For some, this will feel empowering—a raw and honest portrayal of desperation and survival. For others, it might feel too masochistic or frustrating. Yet for those who embrace the darkness and learn to adapt, there's a uniquely rewarding experience buried beneath the madness.\n\nRed Hook Studios continued to support Darkest Dungeon after release with several DLCs, such as The Crimson Court, The Shieldbreaker, and The Color of Madness, each adding new layers of depth, mechanics, and narrative flavor. These expansions further cement the game's reputation as a complex and evolving journey. With the sequel now in the wild, the original remains a masterclass in atmosphere, tension, and systemic storytelling. It's a game that doesn't just test your skills—it tests your patience, resilience, and ability to find hope in the bleakest of places.\n\nIn conclusion, Darkest Dungeon is a towering achievement in indie game design. It is merciless, often cruel, but deeply artistic and philosophically rich. It explores themes rarely touched by other games, such as fear, obsession, and the crushing burden of leadership. For players willing to suffer through its trials, it offers a uniquely cathartic and unforgettable journey. It doesn’t just challenge your characters—it challenges you. And that’s what makes it great.\n\nRating: 8/10", "author_steamid": "76561198367471798", "author_num_games_owned": 29582, "author_num_reviews": 12222, "author_playtime_forever": 1603, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 1603, "author_last_played": "2025-06-26T06:22:53+00:00"}

This is late game values. \r\n\r\nWhere as a single common enemy unit can apply 15+ stress to every unit as just an additional perk to a damaging attack. On top of that your units will lose a virtue roll and then cause +15 stress to their entire team essentially every turn. There's no items to counteract this level of compounding even if you use a campfire and dedicate all your skills to de-stressing. \r\n\r\nThis is another game where dev's threw a new mechanic as a selling point to being different but didn't put much that into after that. A game is challenging if you have agency as a player to circumvent these problems if you respect it enough, you can't do that here it's just an RNG dice roll that you'll sometimes lose. If a mechanic only relies on RNG for you to pass it's not a challenge it's gambling. I beat the game because I do like rogue likes and i'm going to get my money's worth but if I could go back in time I would choose something else.\r\n\r\nI recognized stress is the biggest challenge in the game early and built comps around one shotting key units that apply stress along with the appropriate skills and items. So there are runs you can get absolutely 0 stress. But it literally takes one battle from trash fodder mobs to completely devalue all of your efforts. By then it doesn't matter if you cleared 80% of the dungeon with plenty of supplies and HP, you have to abandon the entire run.

It's not bad, I'm more than ready to put a few more sessions of play to try and progres, but holyy shitt does the progression feel slow.\n\nPeople will defend the game saying that the slow progression is intended, and while I might be inclined to agree I think it is still deeply punishing for newer players that might be trying to take a gander at turn based combat. (I'm newer players lol.) \n\nFirst thing I tried was mitigating risks by avoiding doing the hardest shit with my best heroes, but this stalls the gameplay loop into a harsh repetitive nature, so obviously I try to avoid that.\nSecond thing I tried was having a diverse lineup of heroes in order to enjoy some better variety, but then you're gridlocked into the early-midgame, and gridlocked out of many many deeply impactful trinkets that might make or break some types of playstyles\nIf you try to wait it out for those super impactful trinkets, or maybe you get your hands on one early game, then you'd obviously want to use that hero more often than the others for the sake of actually enjoying the benefits of such a playstyle. Soon enough that hero reaches levels that you actually enjoy playing in! Afterwards, you end up with a near permanent chore of leveling shittier heroes into a more enjoyable state.\n\nThe consistency of somewhere around +20 30 accuracy from tinkets, on top of the GUILD UPGRADES providing a lot more accuracy/effectiveness aswell, all lead to the upper crust of heroes playing much more consistently, and therefor much more enjoyably in a game that people may call bullshit on for being too RNG dependent.\n\nI used accuracy for an example but most of the mechanics that some heroes capabilities lean on will be dependent on their higher capabilities. Trying to claw your way out of being forced to level up 2-3 veterancy heroes for the capability to actually use them on missions you care about, with loadouts that are infinitely more diverse and capable, is simply not that great.\n\nSaying \"Just upgrade the wagon!\" doesn't stop the fact I need the guild hall to make higher veterancy worth it. Not to mention the blacksmith which adds more strength in terms of health and damage at a base. No matter what, to avoid the grind for the most part you need to reach a point in progression where nearly the whole town is able to uphold a meat grinder. Hiring new heroes is definitely a good prospect, but it sure is expensive getting their gear and skills in check!\n\nThis is all without mentioning the quirk system, where many negative quirks or sicknesses can be deeply annoying to deal with when mixed with all the already stated reasons above: *Another* cost that needs a remedy, more time that good heroes stay away from the field, a grind that tells you to go fix up some B tiers for a while until you get back to an actually enjoyable team composition.\n\nLowkey, I don't actually know how they could fix this game, plus they released a sequel so obviously I'm not exactly expecting an update that remedies any of this. If you enjoy the game as is I fully understand why (especially if you can enjoy the aesthetics and pace of combat for like 60+ hours?) But genuinely, this game will not be for everyone. It has a much thicker filter than others I've tried.", "author_steamid": "76561199519248874", "author_num_games_owned": 31, "author_num_reviews": 2, "author_playtime_forever": 989, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 989, "author_playtime_at_review": 989, "author_last_played": "2026-01-28T05:29:21+00:00"}

Otherwise, find the tenacity to care enough to finish an eventually empty endeavor. Or pretend its worth your time: its all up to you and what youre willing to give up for likely meager personal reward. Or resolve to believe it means something to you.

For example, I won my first 3-4 quests, then had terrible RNG on the next two. Those two runs depleted my resources so quickly, that now, even at the easiest difficulty, I have no resources and can only go into quests naked. Sure I can abandon the quest once I find items, but then my team gets no resolve and I have to spend a big portion of the resources I obtained abandoning quests on alleviating the stress of the team. \r\n\r\nEventually I'll come back and hopefully have a better understanding of the mechanics, but after 5 hours of gameplay, it seems the core appreciation of this game is how blatantly BS the resource loop is.\r\n\r\nGit gud or whatever but for now this shit is trash in my humble opinion", "author_steamid": "76561198041977695", "author_num_games_owned": 518, "author_num_reviews": 43, "author_playtime_forever": 332, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 332, "author_last_played": "2025-04-08T22:18:02+00:00"}

Nach jedem abgeschlossenen Dungeon haben Charaktere die Chance, Quirks zu bekommen die entweder vorteilhaft oder schlecht für Kämpfe oder das Erkunden der Dungeons sein können.

Neither of which actually get as far as reviewing the game. \n\nHowever .... many of the negative reviews for Darkest Dungeon are actually right on the money. \nTone, setting, art design, notional game mechanics and especially the narration / VO work. All good. \n\nBut then the flip side is that the game is so unbelieveably grindy AND ... when you think you've built up some momentum, you try your first level 5 mini boss you wipe so comprehensively, losing stuff and people in the process, and watch a good many hours vanish like Keyser-Bloomin-Soze. \nAnd that's not even feeling like you're on the home straight. \nOr you even know where the home straight is. \n\nNo-one expects to win every battle. But there shouldn't be a need to grind another 8 hours just to get to that battle again and wonder what you did wrong the last time. Because more often than not you didn't do anything wrong, it's just 'luck'. \nThat's not good game design that's just lame.   \n\nBecause this is marathon after marathon after marathon. And it never changes into a Snickers. \nOnly onion. \nRemember that bit in the film The Dictator when Nadal says to Aladeen, he is like an onion... \n... Darkest Dungeon is the onion. \n\nAnd to top it all off, this is on easy setting. \nIt's not that the game is difficult, it's just that shizzle happens that you cannot mitigate for. \nSo what's the point?\nThat's not difficult, that's just being a [[insert expletive]]. Game designers we're looking at you. \n\nOn one very short run through my starting two heroes got killed before I even reached the Hamlet. \nI kid you not. What is the point in that?\nIs there anything I could have done differently? \nNo. \nSooooooo.... what's the point?\nIf that happens without any poor choices made on the part of the player then there is something fundamentally wrong with the game design. \n\nHaving completed Slay the Spire on lvl 20 ascension, FTL on hard and X-com on hardest, I still go back to those games to play. Because they are fun. \n\nDarkest Dungeon is not fun. Time invested does not equal reward. \nThe disclaimer at the start of the game that heroes will die ... blah blah blah ... doesn't negate the fact that the game is time sink hole. \nAnd it doesn't feel like a fun sinkhole. \nIt's an onion.\n\nDarkest Dungeon could have been a reasonably good turn based strategy but it isn't. \nIt's incredibly flawed by the repetitive (and dare I say it) conceited time-wasting design.\nTop 50 games of all time? \nYou're havin' a laugh!\nOnly for those people who have only played a maximum of 49 other games.", "author_steamid": "76561198055756290", "author_num_games_owned": 0, "author_num_reviews": 25, "author_playtime_forever": 12779, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 7916, "author_playtime_at_review": 6138, "author_last_played": "2026-01-30T14:06:23+00:00"}

I'm only a couple hours in, but I have to say I'm enjoying this one immensely.  I'm genuinely surprised, because while I love the idea and the gameplay loop of these types of games, and have enjoyed a bit of Slay the Spire and Monster Train, for example, those others never quite hit right for me.  Slay the Spire just really bores me, personally, and Monster Train is kinda similar in that I just feel like I'm doing the same thing over and over.  In Darkest Dungeon, having to wok on your soldiers' stress levels, upgrade skills, upgrade equipment, hire new soldiers, etc., just adds so much for me that the other similar games are missing (once again, for me personally).  Sometimes your best troop is super stressed so you have to take your #2 tank or something, and sometimes you lose a team member, and they're perma-dead (I didn't realize you could retreat until after my first death haha).  The team management and town upgrading just adds so much compared to the other similar games I've played.  Also, the different dungeon types having different monsters so different strategies/team compositions will work better in different dungeons, is a huge plus.\n\nI haven't tried any of the DLCs, but they're all on sale for -75% off now too, and I'm sure will be again since I got the base game on sale a few months ago and it is already on sale again now.  Anyway, as I write this the game is on sale for $3.74 so it's less than a XL cup of coffee.  You basically can't go wrong at that point ($3.74 for a game with 126.6k reviews \"Very Positive\"), and even at the full price of $25 I'd think this one is probably worth it for anyone who enjoys these types of games.", "author_steamid": "76561198043882911", "author_num_games_owned": 0, "author_num_reviews": 68, "author_playtime_forever": 253, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 139, "author_last_played": "2025-02-13T07:39:10+00:00"}

You lead a rotating roster of flawed heroes into plague-ridden ruins, cursed forests, and ancient crypts—all in service of cleansing your family estate of its Lovecraftian rot. But here’s the catch: the real enemy isn’t the monsters. It’s despair.\n\nWhat makes [i]Darkest Dungeon [/i]special is how well it integrates mental strain into its mechanics. You’re managing health bars, yes, but you’re also managing fear, stress, madness, and trauma. Every torch that flickers out, every trap you fail to disarm, every ally that breaks ... chips away at your team’s sanity.\n\nIt’s cruel. It’s beautiful. It’s genius. [i]Darkest Dungeon[/i] is the rare game that fully commits to its thesis: adventuring is hell, and it breaks people. But if you embrace the darkness—if you can handle losing your best healer to a heart attack mid-boss fight—you’ll find a deeply rewarding experience. Every little victory feels earned, and every torch-lit step into the abyss unforgettable.\n\n🤯[b] Pros:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Innovative stress system. Not only do characters take damage, but they also suffer from stress, develop phobias, lash out at allies, or spiral into hopelessness. \n\n[*] Tense, turn-based combat. Positioning matters. The combat system is deep and tactical, with turn order, team synergy, and formation all playing critical roles. You’ll agonize over each decision—attack now or heal? Shuffle positions or protect the squishy hero? It’s slow-burn, edge-of-your-seat stuff.\n\n[*] Grim, unforgettable art style. Heavily inked lines, bold reds and blacks, and gothic animation make every moment look like a page from a cursed comic book. Each hero class is visually distinct, and the enemy designs—from swine abominations to cosmic horrors—are deliciously grotesque.\n\n[*] Narration to die for. Wayne June’s voice acting is iconic. His deep, apocalyptic narration is your constant companion, reacting to crits, deaths, discoveries, and defeats with poetic dread. Lines like “Remind yourself that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer” become mantras.\n\n[*] Meaningful town management. Between expeditions, you manage the Hamlet: sending heroes to the sanitarium, tavern, or abbey to recover. Choosing who gets treated, who gets upgraded, and who gets benched adds another layer of strategic weight. Everything costs gold, and your best soldiers may be out of commission just when you need them.\n\n[*] Replayable and customizable. No two runs are the same. With different hero classes, quirks, trinkets, and dungeon layouts, each campaign plays out differently. You can also modify the difficulty, use mods, and take on challenge modes like Stygian or the endless Darkest level.\n\n[*] Embraces loss as part of the story. Heroes will die. That’s the point. It’s about learning to live with failure, to rebuild after loss, and to keep going even when the game is actively kicking you down. The emotional highs only work because of the crushing lows.\n[/list]\n\n🔦[b] Cons:[/b]\n[list]\n[*] Grinding can be slow. Especially later in the game, progression can stall without a fair bit of grinding. Repeating missions for money or heirlooms might feel tedious after a while, especially if RNG punishes you repeatedly.\n\n[*] RNG can feel cruel, not fair. Missing a 90% stun, getting crit three times in a row, or watching your tank suffer a heart attack out of nowhere can feel unfair. \n\n[*] Combat is slow-paced. Every fight is deliberate and lengthy. That’s by design, but if you’re someone who prefers snappy turn-based combat, this might test your patience.\n\n[*] Story is atmospheric, not character-driven. Don’t expect party banter or branching arcs. The story is told through setting, item descriptions, and narration, not dialogue or cutscenes. The mood is rich, but the plot is minimal.\n[/list]\n[hr]\nIf you enjoyed this review, please check out my curator page to find more: [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/45814768-Verdict-Play-or-Pass/]Verdict: Play or Pass.

[/h1]\n\nI am going to continue playing this game but I feel like it requires too many out of game guides, tutorials and wiki pages to explain the actual mechanics of things.  The game could use a lot more small reminders like when going to do a quest it can list the flaws of the party that affect combat or exploration so you don't have to deal with tedious bookkeeping.  I would also recommend Flaws have bonuses to them so the choice to remove them isn't just money related.   As an example fear of humans can cause higher stress when fighting humans but confer a bonus like dodge, accuracy, or damage.  It might also have the added benefit of making me feel a bit more attached to a character.\n\nThe combat can be slow and tedious especially when someone crys about something causing allies to take sanity damage; meanwhile I am wondering why this has take at least 5-10 seconds every time it happens slowing down the gameplay.\n\nI am not really a fan of not being able to purchase out of combat healing as it feels silly leaving someone alive so your party can make out in order to not head into a fight with a bunch of missing health.

The worst part of the game BY FAR is the arbitrary difficulty. I could overlook the painful slowness of character movement, the inconsistent stat readability, the boring unlocks, the almost uselessly-small inventory (and inventory selection), the annoying involuntary mini-map manipulation, and the rest of the meta pain points, were it not for the glaring issues with manufactured difficulty.\n\nEverything in the game is trying to portray some sense of bleak hopelessness and cthulhu-esque mythos, which the devs apparently thought should mean the player does not get to enjoy themselves. However, the player should not feel uninspired by the character's experience. It's not the feeling of overcoming insurmountable odds and achieving the impossible in the face of certain doom; it's the feeling of yawning to death and uninstalling in the face of certain recycling through a bad gameloop for a hundred hours.\n\nThe loop goes like this:\n\nRecruit some fodder, then go into a dungeon. But your fodder has to WANT to go; if they're too high or too low a level, then they refuse. But before you go, fiddle around with the entire roster for twenty minutes by shuffling them through hoops in town to cure the maladies they acquired, which makes them unavaliable until next time you leave town. Also, don't forget to unequip everything and re-equip it on the other fodder you slotted in to replace the recuperating fodder. Or, who cares, leave the stuff equipped on the invalids because it's no good anyway- most everything has negative effects to go along with their not-that-helpful positive effects. Later on, you'll get better equipment that won't matter either, because:\n\nOnce you go in the dungeon, you have to satisfy a clear condition while slowly plodding down hallways with no distinctive layouts, sometimes doubling back (slowly) to walk on more invisible traps that you never get a chance to disarm, and encountering groups of enemies that invariably\nA. Hit harder than you\nB. Hit more often than you\nC. Do more AOE than you\nD. Can re-up their entire roster if you try to heal yourself for even a single round\nE. Have way too many HP for their dungeon level\nF. In. Chat.\n\nBut while you do that, you're also going crazy just from existing, because oooh, spooky. These battle-hardened veterans of the hellwars who have waded through entire herds of lance-wielding pig centaurs and undead will most certainly lose their minds from simply standing around in the dark for thirty seconds. You're also being tempted with items that are all trapped and give you negative attributes for opening them, which might lead you to ignore them, except nope, since your characters went crazy earlier, they now auto-open random items and get worse traits to go with their already completely-scuffed portfolio.\n\nAlso, you run out of money to fix the traits pretty quickly, so now you're just staring at an entire rack of fodder in town that is fully stressed and completely bugnuts before you've even stepped foot in a dungeon. But don't worry, you can retreat and abandon your quests (which causes more stress, which causes more craziness), so if you're facing bankruptcy, just go into a dungeon (after spending twenty minutes fiddle-farking around in town with lists, every time, isn't this fun gameplay?) and fight A SINGLE ENCOUNTER, get one of your fodder outright killed because the enemies, in addition to the above stuff, also team-target a single character and dogpile them twice before your party gets to act AT ALL, slog through the fight, and then run back to town, which should give you exactly enough to heal one guy on your rack of six to ten crazies. And then go back and do it again until you have a party of four manageably-sane fodder (you've spent two or three hours at this point screwing with lists, let's not forget), after which you take them into a dungeon that is listed as level 3, which is exactly what all your party member's levels are at, and they are immediately dunked on because:\n\nMiss. Miss. Miss. MISS. MISS. MISS. Miss. Miss. Miss. MISS. Huh, what's my accuracy? 90? Oh, but they have 10 dodge. So... 80? That's still better than average chance to hit, right? MISS. MISS. MISS.

Weird, the monsters hit me at a rate of 75-90% and frequently get all four party members at once. Maybe I can put some accuracy charms on my guys? Where even ARE some accuracy charms? Ok, I finally found some and wasted a charm slot on accuracy that could have been something partially useful if my career soldier already knew how to aim a sword at a stunned target (stunned means they miss a turn, not that they're, y'know, stunned...). Oh, and once I use my one ration of firewood I can put some buffs on my party, and this one guy can put this one buff that gets one other guy some accuracy, so now I'm sure to be able to connect with som...MISS. MISS. Miss. Miss. MISS. God, isn't this great gameplay? *yawn* Time to fidget some more lists!\n\nAnd the entire time, there is a disembodied narrator giving the same tired, goading speeches every ten or so seconds...for hours. You could turn off the narration, of course- but then you'd miss actual lore when it happens. Unless, of course, you fidget the list every time you want to hear actual narration instead of \"You stepped on a trap (that you couldn't see), pray it doesn't become a habit.\" and \"Keep killing the enemies (that you can't do anything but kill, you want to tell me to continue breathing or anything else while you're at it there bud?), press the advantage (that you never had).\" Or you could put on subtitles, which is just as tedious.\n\nWhere is fast travel? Where is auto-purchase? Why am I grinding for resources IMMEDIATELY going into level 1? Why am I not allowed to grind without imminent risk of party kill? Why is the game bad when it could have been good? Why do you want me not to enjoy the game?\n\nThere is the outline of a good game hiding underneath the mountain of crap here; more resources, more USEFUL resources, more meaningful player actions, less juggernaut-tank enemies, less lists, less microfidgeting with lists, less meaninglessness, better UI, larger inventory...there's a lot of things that could have flipped this into great fun. Instead, it went from two hours of interest to four hours of deepening dismay and realization to two final hours of complete loss of interest, much in the same way as Jump King did for me. I like platformers, but Jump King isn't a platformer; it's a micromanagement precision game masquerading as a platformer. Similarly, I enjoy roguelite/likes and dungeon crawlers, but DD isn't that- it's a kick-you-in-the-nuts simulator with hours of forced and incredibly boring interaction that, god help me, would have been better as an idle game.\n\nNo comments enabled because I don't need you telling me \"You just don't get it\" and \"Some games aren't for everyone\". This game is bad for reasons that have nothing to do with my personal preferences. It presents everything just well enough to slide on into your shopping cart, whereupon it gradually becomes moldy mayonnaise in the refrigerator door; poisonous and bland, uselessly taking up space better reserved for mustard just because you wanted some tuna salad that one day.

A review: A deep and well made RPG, with some base building elements. A heavy theme of horror and lovecraftian menace flow throughout the story. Strategize for your fores into the dungeons, as you dive deep into the broken and corrupted estate of your ancestor. Plan your expedition well; for preparation (and supplies) is paid for in Gold (you earn) now and later in blood if you choose to go light on supplies. Inventory management is important, as your treasure earned will take up slots that you may need for your party to heal, eat, or get through obstacles. Upgrade your estate to prepare for even greater horrors to come. Your heroes will become stronger as they beat threats and complete missions. They will need your help (and investment) in better gear: Armor, Weapons and other tools. Seek out Trinkets and Baubles: they will offer your heroes advantages that a sharpened sword or stronger shield can not. Beware, they will suffer horror and stress (one of the core mechanics of the game) in these dungeons that will take effort of their employer (You) to fix. As they see the horrors and violence, or see others fail or fall in combat, they will become overwhelmed, even developing specific types of mental conditions as the stress causes a test of their resolution. Sometimes, they will overcome their fear and find a bravery that few men or women (both who will be hired by you, as the scion and their leader) normally possess. But all too often, they will become paranoid, or fearful, or irrational. And they may ignore your order, harm themselves, or attack or act on their own (the game is dark in some ways that are realistic, or at least may lead some folks to feel uncomfortable. Just a note). But you will need to, as the player (and their leader/employer), find and learn about the various systems that this RPG will present for your. There will be trial and error. You *will* lose allies and those you hire. And those heroes will not return, if they are gone, they will stay as such. You may chose to retreat from a mission to save a hero(s), and you can retreat from battles and come back or approach things a different way. But remember, they will suffer stress of defeat, and this is a game of challenge and difficulty. Much like any game of lovecraftian horror should be. A last word: sometimes you will find curious objects, curios if you will. Some will be helpful, some will be harmful, and some can do both. *Do* pay close attention to the wording and how they are described. And do keep in mind, your supplies may have more than one use, and may have a curios interaction.

But Darkest Dungeon's masochism is different. \r\n\r\nThe game is all about management. \r\nEach character has a stress bar. Hit 100 and you get a really bad random affliction (penalty). Hit 200 and your HP instantly goes to 0 because... they had a \"heart attack\" (shrugs) but here's the interesting part. This game doesn't kill your character instantly, instead it puts that character in a \"death's door\" state where if they get another hit they'll go over that state's threshold and permanently die. You can negate this state with a healing skill on that character. And you can negate and get \"Death's Door\" repeatedly, it's not a the next time you die... no, the game wants you butt clenched as you pray to whoever is up there so your character doesn't die from a bleed you didn't wanna use bandages on.\r\n\r\nLiterally keeping things one mistake away from their death.\r\n\r\nThat and every room, every loot chance that gives your character a bad trait or compromise your dungeon run, every mob that could stun, make you stressed, and crit your party to death's door. \r\nThat's the gambling aspect. Risking a bad run would deny all your investment on the character you've been using. But quitting is also costly because there's risk you get bad traits. \r\n\r\nThere is no room to breath except when you're camping, even then you could still get ambushed. It's like playing poker/mahjong, except you play with your party member's lives at every hand. One bad encounter, or accumulating bad luck will run your pot dry and someone gets killed.\r\n\r\n[h3]The Pacing...[/h3]\r\n\r\nHonestly this is the most interesting part... \r\nThe pacing of the game isn't bad per se. Since every dungeon run is basically a drug for gambling addicts (though couch traders would deny it...), the game's pace is decided by how fast you can understand the game's mechanic, and how lucky you are to get good items early on. \r\n\r\nHowever, starting off... the game will not give you any good equipment/trinkets, and while you don't need it... the difficulty jump to veteran level dungeons basically requires you to have a concrete party and build already. Personally, I think it's too fast of a learning curve considering how many class of characters there are, and how frequently you need to rotate and mish and mash them. \r\n\r\nFor beginners, I highly recommend getting a mod that lets you bring a lvl 3 character to enter apprentice dungeons... Because the game locks lvl 3 characters to only take veteran and above level dungeons despite you not having a full party yet, or the necessary upgrades. Meanwhile your resources are wasted cycling members to replace resting ones.\r\n\r\nOverall, the pacing doesn't demand anything from you... there's no time limit. But you're also gonna inevitably get harder and harder missions. While apprentice dungeons still comes up, there's only 3 slots / dungeon area for every in-game week. You could get a mission that's inconvenient for you. \r\n\r\nIt's both brilliant and slightly annoying because progression relies heavily on luck.\r\n\r\n[h3]The Modding Community[/h3]\r\n\r\nLet's be honest here... the modding community of this game is one of the biggest incentive of this game. There's a lot of things you can mod from gameplay to character skins. If you really wanted to... you could also make the game easy from it or harder. And there's a lot of premium quality mods the community has made... so if that's what you're interested in, you won't be disappointed.\r\n\r\nOverall, the game is fun if you're into RPGs. There's a lot of depth on party building/synergy, and enemy gimmicks. The stakes keeps things engaging, and no two dungeon diving have the same result as you would a normal RPG.", "author_steamid": "76561199246504167", "author_num_games_owned": 0, "author_num_reviews": 18, "author_playtime_forever": 683, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 655, "author_last_played": "2025-12-29T06:06:08+00:00"}

The core appeal lies in the 'Affliction System,' where heroes battle their own minds as much as the monsters. Every point of stress is a ticking time bomb, and the dynamic effects of a hero breaking down—becoming abusive, selfish, or paranoid—force a tactical disaster that is both brilliant and deeply frustrating. The strategic depth, iconic hand-drawn art style, and world-class narrator make every failure a memorable, quotable tragedy.\n\nThis game is a definitive **Recommended** for fans of high-stakes strategy who embrace permadeath and RNG as core mechanics. This is not a power fantasy; it’s a detailed resource management simulator where the most precious resource is your characters' dwindling sanity and time. Be warned: your investment in your heroes will be punished. You will hate this game, and then immediately start a new expedition.\n\n[hr][/hr]\n\n[h2]Core Analysis: The Management of Suffering[/h2]\n\nThe genius of [i]Darkest Dungeon[/i] is how it weaponizes player attachment. You don't just manage HP and MP; you manage [b]Stress[/b]. When a hero hits 100 Stress, they undergo a Resolve Check. Failing this check forces an Affliction—like the **Masochist** who hits themselves and refuses healing, or the **Paranoid** who passes stress onto the party with constant insults. This loss of player control is the game's core innovation, forcing you to constantly rotate your roster and consider your heroes as expendable resources who might, at any moment, decide to sabotage the entire mission.\n\nThe turn-based combat is deceptively complex. Every hero's skill is tied to a specific positional rank (1-4), meaning your party formation is as critical as your gear. Enemies excel at **shuffling** your heroes with abilities like the Bone Rabble's *Graveyard Slash*. A Crusader knocked into the back rank is essentially useless unless you've planned a recovery. Winning isn't about raw damage; it's about building a versatile team (e.g., Plague Doctor, Vestal, Highwayman, Leper) that can operate effectively *even when shuffled*, ensuring someone can always hit the crucial backline stress-dealer.\n\nThe long-term loop of the game is the intentional grind of the [b]Hamlet[/b]. Every successful run funnels gold and heirlooms into facility upgrades. The true meta-game is upgrading the Blacksmith for better gear, the Guild for new skills, and most importantly, the Sanitarium to remove debilitating negative Quirks like \"Kleptomaniac\" or \"Fear of the Undead.\" This system provides a tangible sense of progression that makes the constant stream of deaths feel like a necessary cost of building a capable roster to take on the final, titular dungeon.\n\n[h2]Technical and Performance Assessment[/h2]\n\nAs a mature title, the PC port of [i]Darkest Dungeon[/i] is highly stable and well-optimized. Performance issues are virtually non-existent, and the hand-drawn 2D art style ensures quick load times and a smooth experience, even on older hardware. For new players, the developers have done a great service by making the highly controversial 'Corpses' and 'Heart Attacks' mechanics optional via the settings menu, which offers a smoother on-ramp to the core challenge. The game also boasts excellent support for a robust Steam Workshop modding scene, which provides years of replayability and quality-of-life adjustments.\n\n[h2]Pros & Cons: The Final Toll[/h2]\n\n[b]Pros[/b]\n[list]\n[*] [i]Iconic and Unforgettable Aesthetic:[/i] The striking hand-drawn 'crowquill' gothic art style is a visual masterpiece.\n[*] [i]World-Class Voice Acting:[/i] The Narrator (Wayne June) provides constant, quotable commentary that elevates the atmosphere to legendary status.\n[*] [i]Innovative Affliction System:[/i] Stress mechanics that truly change gameplay and force high-stakes resource management.\n[*] [i]Deep Positional Combat:[/i] Strategic, rank-based combat that rewards proper party composition and formation management.\n[*] [i]High Replay Value:[/i] Perma-death, procedural dungeons, and extensive modding support extend playtime indefinitely.\n[/list]\n\n[b]Cons[/b]\n[list]\n[*] [i]High RNG Reliance:[/i] A string of unavoidable misses or crits can lead to frustrating, seemingly 'unfair' party wipes.\n[*] [i]Mid-to-Late Game Grind:[/i] The core loop can become repetitive as you grind to replace high-level heroes and farm heirlooms.\n[*] [i]Steep Learning Curve:[/i] Initial lack of clarity on damage formulas and combat tokens can be punishing for total beginners.\n[*] [i]Pack Bonding is Dangerous:[/i] You *will* get attached to a hero, and they *will* die horribly.\n[/list]\n\n[h2]Conclusion[/h2]\n\n[b]Darkest Dungeon[/b] is not a game you play to relax; it is a test of your patience, planning, and ability to manage disaster. The tactical depth of the combat, combined with the psychological nightmare of the Affliction System, creates a unique, memorable, and often punishing experience that no other game has quite matched. While the RNG can be brutal, and the grind is real, these elements are fundamental to the game's core theme: making the best of a bad situation. Embrace the suffering, fire the losers, and pour your coin into the Sanitarium.

This game as it is, is probably the best dungeon crawler game to be ever made, a true statement of it's title. Not only that, but the game succeeds masterfully at it's themes and presentation, it just clicks. The lovecraftian themes are present throughout, creating a dense and engaging atmosphere for a desolate landscape of a ruined family. \r\n\r\nThe Hamlet is a sad place to be in, and it's also where you'll spend about a third of the game, managing heroes, trinkets, and other things such as districts, permabuffs to certain things. One critique to be made, for sure, is the blandness of such aforementioned trinkets, most just increase stats, by noticeable enough amounts once you get rarer trinkets, but perhaps, about 80% of them are just flat out useless. This extends even to character specific trinkets, such as most sets you get from the DLC Crimson Court, a nice idea, but often running the trinket set just doesn't do enough for your character, and stats are often contradictory. On the other hand, hero design is magnificent, both on a design and play standpoint, it's definitely a major selling point, characters are alive, with specific personalities that become even more specific as they get quirks, with a nice format of 8 skills (of which you select 4), and 4 heroes in your party (including the possibility of repeats). This system works wonderfully, as possibilities are huge, and intertwined to the game's positional system of 4 ranks, the amount of ways to arrange your characters is endless, combine this to their very well crafted movesets and dynamics, it's a winning formula for a game with such premises as Darkest Dungeon.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, combat is very fluid, as different dungeons have different enemies that you'll have to adapt your team composition, trinkets, quirks and movesets to. Dungeons feel distinct from eachother, as running to the ruins almost negates most bleed teams, different from, perhaps, the cove, with a plethora of fish that can bleed a ton, but will also bleed, stun, pull, and stress you. That's a good segue into stress, one of the game's selling points. Stress is a major mechanic that you'll have to deal with, a crit to the body of your hero can be as lethal as a wandering mind, that surely becomes afflicted. Abuse, masochism, selfishness, these (and more) are the traits of the afflicted, characters that will act on their own terms, sabotage your team, and stress everyone out. Yet, a ray of hope shines even in stress, as virtues also exist, creating from chaos and desperation, the will to victory, as your heroes become powerful, stalwart, virtuous or courageous. This system, though, is also flawed, but a flaw that was inevitable perhaps, as affliction can almost certainly end runs, but virtues certainly win them, yet, this major mechanic, the longer the game goes, more irrelevant becomes. This is because a huge amount of the game is predicated on NOT stressing your heroes, by the end of the campaign, I probably had no stressed out heroes for maybe over 50 weeks, except the final boss. This, in all, is somewhat nitpicky, but still worth mentioning.\r\n\r\nAs for the games story, it's good, nothing outstanding but certainly intriguing and often times surprising. Keeping up with it would be quite tedious if not for one of the other huge selling points of the game: Wayne June's narration. The Ancestor carries the game's flow, mundane combat encounters with the likes of maggots and skeletons get turnt into bloodbaths as shouts of \"EVISCERATED!\" blare from your speakers. Memorable lines are endless, and the delivery is pefect! \"Great is the weapon that cuts on its own!\", \"Slowly, gently, this is how a life is taken...\", \"Mortality clarified in a single strike!\". My favorites would definitely be, as a hero becomes virtuous \"Many fall in the face of chaos, but not this one, not today.\" or the incredible tirade he goes on at the third level of the Farmstead: \"The poor Miller - Thrice a victim...\" You just have to experience it yourself. \r\n\r\nOn the backhand, there's a certain restraint on upgrades, as most of them just buff numbers, the boringness of trinkets, the final dungeons are definitely a weird bunch, feeling way different than the rest of the game. And the HUGE Courtyard maps can definitely get exhausting, as the game slows down to a halt in the mid-game, as gold becomes scarce yet necessary for everything, meaning until you can save up for a bank and start spending huge, it's just slow. The game's difficulty felt very fair to me, not nearly as challenging as some claim, it's only big problems are random things such as your characters getting crit and bled, and dying on the first action of their turn from said crit bleed that took them from 80% to 0% health. The permadeath of characters emphasizes not taking risks, essentially, it makes the player be very careful, this wouldn't be a problem if not for how unbalanced some aspects of the game are, namely, stuns and raw damage teams. For the first half of the game, it feels challenging because you don't know what works with what, but boy, once I understood that stuns are broken, the game goes WAYYY down in difficulty. Trouble with an enemy? Stun it, almost everything is stunnable. And if you can't stun it, well, then just kill it, some teams can mark and kill an enemy really easily, I'm talking 1 shot easy on anything that isn't a boss. And even in bosses, hell, this is a problem bigger than just enemies, all bosses heavily favor teams that can just melt it, classes like Arbalest and Houndmaster solve almost any boss in the game, and the ones that don't get solved by mark (like the courtyard bosses) instead get very easily solved by other damage dump characters such as Hellion and Leper. The two other big complaints I have in relation to the game is, of course, the grind and the end-game. As I said before, the mid-game sucks because you have no gold and have to do a hundred little missions to be able to get your money generation going, but once it is gone, almost all aspects of town management die. This eases off the tension so much, that it becomes a very annoying grind to end the game, as you probably want maxed out heroes, something you can only do by doing dungeons, but having a single party of max level heroes isn't enough, of course, as your heroes that enter the dungeon get too stressed to go back in. This, though thematically is great, makes ending the game a chore, as you'll have to do a mutiny of no-fun missions just to train a new party to enter the dungeon again, heroes that enter it and come out alive do give out an xp buff to others in the same party, something that would've been great!.. if not for the fact they willn't go to missions lower level than 5, so, you might just take a bunch of level 5s anyway and level 4 heroes instead of 3. This allowance of Darkest Dungeon heroes to go to lower level missions and help others COULD be explained thematically by having them experience Ego Death or something, but no, you have to manually get everyone from level 3 (or lower, God forbid) back to 6 to attempt it the Darkest Dungeon again. This makes it all just a HUGE grind, I felt like the last 10-15h of the game was just me waiting for me to have enough resources to actually end the game, instead of beating new challenges. Also, although doing the Darkest Dungeon missions blind can be very fun, I would heavily recommend you to read a map for Darkest Dungeon 2 and 3, as those missions are just very different from the rest of the game, somewhat tiring, and losing heroes/having to retreat from them could be a huge time-waster, but this is just my opinion.\r\n\r\nOverall, Darkest Dungeon: It's a thematic perfection of a game, that often spills heavy into gameplay, for good and bad. It's great.

I have played over 40 hours in the last two weeks.\r\n\r\nThanks to a friend I was able to find a combination of mods that made the game bearable, fixing the problems that made me bounce out my first time through, and it was a really fun experience! Most of the time. Ultimately I feel like Darkest Dungeon is a very confused experience. You're supposed to go in, get dunked on, learn, and go in again, but it punishes you severely for getting dunked on, and it means you're not supposed to get attached to your characters even though you get to name and customize them. It genuinely feels like they wanted to make a roguelike and ended up with an RPG somehow, which is why I'm excited to see how they did 2 as a roguelike. And yet, I had a lot of fun making builds and testing them with the risk of losing them if it wasn't as good as I'd planned and finding the dev named teams. The most fun way of playing ends up being the wrong one that will cause you the most suffering and send you right back into the grind, it's a really confused system. But this game has a vision, and sticks to it with every aspect, I can respect that, even if I disagree (sometimes vehemently) with it. \r\n\r\nMy recommendation is, if you're gonna play it, mod the shit out of it. Change whatever it is you need to make the experience fun for you.

And that kind of masochistic symphony is what makes me love this game so much.\r\n\r\nBetween the Butcher's Circus and the Crimson Court, there's just *no end* to the content this game gives, and sure - you could argue that it's just repetitive dungeon crawling, but you don't realise how much each run can change based on who you bring, how experienced they are, and how much stress it can give you (and your characters) when they start hoarding things for their own pleasure.\r\n\r\nBut what makes the game really shine, in this writer's humble opinion, is the sheer amount of attachment you can develop to a guy called \"Crusader\". He's just a knight knockoff from Dark Souls, and never gets more than a single quip during a run - but after all the skills and weapon upgrades you've bought for him, all the alcoholism, holy penance or deviant debauchery you've bestowed upon his sadistic b*tthole, any severance you notice becomes so much more defining of the experience you get. At the end of the day, these wayward souls don't give a single f*ck about you or the dungeon they're in, and they'll eventually end up making choices for themselves and leave you helpless to restrain them.\r\n\r\nAnd that's why you should get this game.

Now, they may be asking themselves whether the free DLC Kingdoms changes anything in this regard.\n\nWell, it does. Keep reading.\n\nLet me preface this by saying that Darkest Dungeon 1 has, from day one, been in my top three games of all time (the other two being Valheim and Crusader Kings 3). I, too, was gravely disappointed when they changed the formula. And even though the major flaw that, in my opinion, kept the first installment from perfection—the graphics (don't get me wrong, I love the dark, comic-like art-style, I just wished they made the characters more human-like)—was greatly improved upon, I couldn’t imagine the game without the hamlet, where my party of psychiatric ward patie...—I mean, heroes—could return, giving me a sense of place and continuity.\n\nI refrained from getting DD2, hoping that one day they would release a third installment. And guess what?\nThe latest game mode, Kingdoms, is exactly what I was dreaming of. And even though it may sound blasphemous to fans of the first game, I’ll say it outright: DD2: Kingdoms is better than DD1.\n\nNow, with most readers gone, I will try to support my bold statement by comparing both games in the two most important aspects: the hamlet and the heroes.\n\nThe hamlet is back—but this time, there isn’t just one, but dozens of them (called Inns). While in DD1, the order of upgrades was largely the same in every run, here you must decide which Inns will specialize in what: some will offer cheaper goods, others will have better medics, and some will let you train your heroes more effectively. You won’t be able to upgrade all of them, and some you will never get to visit again because you may fail to defend them from the beastmen, losing them permanently.\nThis greatly improves on the single-hamlet system of DD1, forcing you into an agonizing decision-making process with every upgrade, fearing that you may never get to use it again. And we all know how scarce resources are in this game.\n\nAnd now, for the biggest and best change: the heroes.\nIn DD2: Kingdoms, you only have one of each type—which makes your connection to them much more personal. They are no longer disposable shells, replaced the moment they die by carbon copies. Instead, they feel like real people, with quirks, relationships, and stories. Once they’re gone, they’re gone. It’s a fantastic feature, one that I didn’t even realize I wanted so badly. I mean, I always knew that DD1 had great storytelling potential when it came to its heroes, but that potential was wasted because of how easy they were to replace.\nNot anymore.\nIn DD2, each run introduces new stories with new main characters, ones that you will remember long after finishing the game. Not many games achieve this. The ones that do are masterpieces. DD1 was a masterpiece. DD2: Kingdoms does it even better—which I considered impossible.\n\nThe King is Dead. Long Live the King.\n\nP.S. R.I.P. Wayne June.

And beating your head against them?  Great news!  This game is designed to appeal specifically to you, and only to you.\n\nThis is a rogue-\"light\" (ha ha) turn based dungeon crawler, where you recruit heroes from a roster to form your four person party.  With 17 classes that all sport unlockable abilities, there's a lot of mixing and maxing that can be done - if you can keep your heroes alive.  You might be tempted to give them little names, change their outfits, personalize their appearances - NO.  DO NOT.  You see, it's not just HP that you're managing - heroes also have a separate \"stress\" meter.  And when they are pushed to their limit, heroes develop fun personality traits based on their experiences in the dungeon (abusive, selfish, paranoid, etc., occasionally you'll get a good one but mostly bad).\n\nAnd once one member gets that negative trait, they will continuely drag your non-toxic party members down like a bitter high school bully with sarcastic and despairing commentary, wearing away their mental health until they too crumble like the ruins you're all exploring, either developing their own negative traits in turn or having a stress-induced heart attack.  And abandoning or retreating also, I don't know, damages your heroes' sense of self worth and makes them SAD so they get even more stressed.\n\nYou can treat your heroes at the buildings in town - this will also eat up your funds and you'll need to collect the crests, deeds, journal pages, etc. that you find in the lovely areas to make upgrading more efficient so it will become necessary to just throw hoards of bodies into dungeons, ill-provisioned and equipped, to get the necessary funds to save your Good Guys.\n\nThe game recommends its \"Radiant\" (Easy) mode FOR A REASON.  LISTEN TO IT.  I dismissed that warning and started in Normal \"mode\", and now that save file is unplayable because my heroes are all dead, stressed, too under-leveled, or are so psychologically destroyed that an army of psychologists would be employed for years.\n\nRadiant mode is a much better introduction and it STILL feels like beating your head against a wall.  But it allows you a little more breathing room to figure out how all the mechanics interact to deeply screw you much better than normal difficulty.\n\nAnyway, I hate love this (hate this) and I'm definitely completing it at least ONCE.

You can change your skills, add trinkets that give buffs and do a bunch of managment like - do I remove the stress from this hero and then I cure his disease during a camping period.\n\nOverall 8/10\n \n\n", "author_steamid": "76561198132073172", "author_num_games_owned": 0, "author_num_reviews": 58, "author_playtime_forever": 8992, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 8992, "author_last_played": "2025-04-17T07:57:47+00:00"}

But I've played this game for 140 hours, and I've never finished it. I just can't make it all the way through. And the problem: RNG. Now I'm familiar with playing around probabilities, minimizing risk, having backup plans, etc. But just because I can usually manage the RNG doesn't make the moments where it really screws you any more fun. Because that's the problem--there is SO MUCH RNG that there is no way to mitigate it all. Turn order is random, accuracy is random, damage is random, dodge is random, crits are random, death blows are random, stress causing virtues and afflictions is random, debuffs are random, encounters are random, curios have random effects, loot is random, healing is random, when you need to eat is random, if you get ambushed when you sleep is random, its just random random random random! \n\nThe last time I quit the game I had an occultist I really liked with a high level party, and we got into a surprise battle with some spiders. And the spiders got high speed rolls and all moved first, they all randomly decided to attack the occultist, they all hit, they blighted, and then before I could get a turn in the blight won the random deathblow chance and killed him. Sure it was tragic and dramatic and fit the narrative of the setting, but it also sucked because it was completely unfair and took away all player agency. That's what RNG does, it replaces well-designed systems that the player can influence with games of chance that take agency away from the player. \n\nSo this game is great if you are interested in gambling with the quality of your entertainment, it can be super fun! It can suck! Who knows what will happen! But it could have just been consistently fun if the developers hadn't chosen to include as many RNG systems as they could.", "author_steamid": "76561198054712857", "author_num_games_owned": 246, "author_num_reviews": 33, "author_playtime_forever": 8439, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 8439, "author_last_played": "2022-03-31T22:02:32+00:00"}

After that, I found that only terrible luck and running into unknown enemies were the cause of deaths.\r\n\r\nDeaths do come with a large real-life time punishment in my opinion.  The later into the game you go, the more time will take to re-level a hero to replace one that had been killed. This makes the game is a bit of a marathon, and I think this is embodied in the final two quests.  They are long and intend to grind your heroes down slowly.\r\n\r\n***One last thought, for those who like thinking about game design***\r\n\r\nThe game presents itself as a game where you go through a huge number of heroes to fight off the unspeakable horrors. I didn't have that experience.  I had relatively low number of deaths.\r\n\r\nI wonder if this tweak would have made deaths less grindy to recover from and yet maintain that presentation:\r\n\r\nHave the player choose from a group of heroes with varied classes, quirks, and maybe skills.  You have to pick the team that you think will get you through the next quest.  After the quest--win or die--the team is disbanded and you have to choose four new heroes for the next quest attempt.\r\n\r\nThis way if your heroes die, you don't have to spend time leveling them back up in dungeons that don't give you any issues, and you actually \"force\" the idea of throwing waves of heroes at the enemies and show that the heroes are always irrevocably too damaged to continue.  Just a thought.\r\n\r\nGood luck, and may the cosmos have mercy on you.\r\n", "author_steamid": "76561199054515710", "author_num_games_owned": 84, "author_num_reviews": 19, "author_playtime_forever": 21633, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 21633, "author_last_played": "2025-02-21T03:00:47+00:00"}

You remember the layout, the screams, the smell of failure… but somehow you’ve convinced yourself you’re ready this time. The art still slaps, the sound design still oozes despair, and that narrator still sounds like he’s reading your eulogy.\r\n\r\nWhat strikes me now is the freedom of failure. In a world full of roguelikes that encourage “run it again,” Darkest Dungeon never pretended you were supposed to win cleanly. You recruit, you lose, you rebuild — and it’s still your fault when the Highwayman gets syphilis and bleeds out because you cheaped out on bandages.\r\n\r\nThe sandbox design still holds up because it gives you ownership over the misery. You can min-max your party, run suicide missions for loot, or send the B-team into the Warrens just to see what survives. There’s real strategy in knowing when to fight and when to cut your losses — retreating isn’t failure, it’s resource management.\r\n\r\nDarkest Dungeon II tried to bottle the same stress into a road trip — but after playing both, you realise the original’s Hamlet loop was genius. The grind was the story. The downtime between horrors gave meaning to your next descent. DDII may be prettier and more cinematic, but DD1 remains the better sandbox of suffering.\r\n\r\nComing back years later, it’s aged like cursed wine — darker, more bitter, but still intoxicating. If anything, time has made its lessons clearer:\r\n\r\nSometimes, victory is surviving the week with just enough sanity to do it again.\r\n\r\n8 out of 10 flagellant lashes - hurts so good!", "author_steamid": "76561197978024377", "author_num_games_owned": 0, "author_num_reviews": 70, "author_playtime_forever": 3933, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 2949, "author_last_played": "2026-01-02T07:00:56+00:00"}

[/h2]\n\nIt’s not about “being bad at hard games.” I’ve beaten genuinely tough titles. The problem here is the RNG—an ever-present, coin-flip chaos that steamrolls any sense of skill or planning.\n\nYou can sink thousands of resources into a hero only to watch them get one-shot because a boss has some opaque gimmick you didn’t divine from its muddled telegraphs. And when they die, they stay dead. Permadeath is fine when the rules are legible. Here it just feels like the dice decided your time doesn’t matter.\n\nEnd of run? Cool, roll the bones again. There’s a high chance—often around 75%—to pick up random quirks, including gems like –20% HP when Stress > 50%. You can hit that stress threshold in a single fight because some clown decides to spike it by 20 with a goofy animation. Great design: you get punished for playing, then punished again for having played.\n\nThe whole thing reads like the devs didn’t know how to manage difficulty, so they hid rubber-banding behind “RNG.” Player at full HP? Nudge a hidden slider. Doing too well? Flip a table. It’s not emergent chaos; it’s a slot machine wearing a grimdark mask.\n\nBring a healer—the Vestal, obviously—and watch the game target and tilt her until you’re chain-healing your healer every two or three turns while also babysitting her stress bar that skyrockets well past the rest of the party. It genuinely feels like the system resents you for bringing a legitimate support and will do anything to make it a liability.\n\nThen there’s the affinity/relationship nonsense, a “gotcha” layer that randomly scrambles your plans because the dice felt spicy. It’s not strategy; it’s sabotage by spreadsheet.\n\nThis isn’t “hard.” It’s a time sink engineered to manufacture frustration and call it design.\n\nDear devs: harder is not automatically better.

Musiques de malade. narration 11/10.\n\nAvant toute chose, sachez que j'ai l'habitude des jeux durs, des rogue-like demandant de la réflexion, et j'adore les challenges. Je peux jouer au jeu le plus dur du monde et l'adorer mais à deux conditions : que je n'ai pas l'impression de perdre mon temps et surtout, SURTOUT qu'il soit [u] juste.[/u]\n\nSauf que c'est clairement pas le cas de celui là.\n\n[h1] Prenons un exemple : [/h1]\nContexte : j'ai fait le donjon 5 fois avec cette équipe et plus de 20 fois en tout, inutile de dire que je connais bien la zone\n\nDéjà cette fois-là particulièrement le layout du donjon était horrible.\nBien que j'ai fait cette même quête 10 fois auparavant avec la même quantité de nourriture, et bien cette fois-ci j'en avais pas assez. Je n'ai eu absolument aucun contrôle sur cette situation. \n\nLe TOUT PREMIER combat de la TOUTE PREMIERE PIECE a fait atteindre 80 de stress à mon médecin de la peste sans que je ne puisse ABSOLUMENT rien faire (mon premier tour de jeu a vu mon équipe rater 4 fois les 2 incantateurs adverses sur des 90% de réussite, grandiose). Je n'ai eu absolument aucun contrôle sur cette situation non plus. \n\nET EVIDEMMENT il a fallu que je tombe sur le SEUL layout en 7 heures de jeu qui nécessitait 2 pelles. Evidemment. En 2 pièces mon médecin de la peste est devenu fou. Encore une fois aucun contrôle.\n\nLe layout a affamé mon équipe parce que je n'avais pas assez de nourriture mais encore une fois ne connaissant pas le layout du donjon en avance je suis obligé de piffer complètement mes provisions ? j'ai fait 15 runs où 12 suffisait mais je dois en déduire que une fois sur 15 je dois en prendre 16 c'est ça ? Encore une fois aucun contrôle.\n\nAvant d'entrer dans la toute dernière salle et de valider la quête,  le collecteur spawn (4% de chance que ça arrive) et j'en ai déjà battu un avant SAUF QUE le début du donjon m'a déjà fisté mon médecin de la peste et aussi accessoirement la seule classe de mon équipe qui aurait pu s'en sortir contre lui. Aussi pour je ne sais quel raison je ne pouvais pas fuir ce combat en particulier (???). Donc je dois en déduire que je dois prendre en compte en montant mon équipe que même si elle a pu faire 5 fois le donjon avant je devrais faire des changements pour inclure le fait que j'ai 4% de chance de me faire wipe si je ne le fais pas ? Aucun contrôle de la situation. Encore.\n\nJe l'ai déjà fait plein de fois avant mais là je me retrouve avec un layout horrible, affamé, sans possibilité de fuir et à une pièce de la fin du donjon pour que juste en fait, et même en le connaissant par coeur, le jeu décide de me faire perdre mon équipe ? \n\nBilan :\n\n[u] Est-ce que ma connaissance de jeu (et du donjon) a été récompensée ? [/u] Non. \n[u] Est-ce que j'ai perdu parce que j'ai mal fait certaines choses ? [/u] Ma seule issue aurait été de fuir mais même mon ami (qui a fini le jeu en stygien accessoirement) a été surpris que l'option de fuite ait été désactivée. J'estime donc que non.\n[u] Est-ce que j'ai appris quelque chose d'intéressant pour mes runs futures ? [/u] Oui. Que le jeu est injuste.\n\nCa a wipe mon équipe et accessoirement 3h de jeu passée avec (sans compter les ressources utilisées pour eux) à cause d'un truc que je déteste : une injustice. J'ai perdu parce que le jeu voulait que je perde. Je n'ai rien appris parce que je suis mort sur un truc que je connaissais déjà, juste par une succession de malchance. \n\nEt quand j'ai compris ça et surtout vu qu'il était impossible d'utiliser des héros de plus haut niveau pour faire XP les personnages plus bas niveau, j'ai tout de suite compris que j'allais repasser des heures de gameplay répétitifs juste pour compenser le fait que le jeu décide parfois de détruire ma progression pour le fun. Et ce genre de situation complètement injuste et sans intérêt m'est arrivé plus d'une fois en 7h de jeu.\n\nEt ça, ça ne s'appelle pas de la difficulté. Ce n'est pas un jeu difficile. C'est un jeu INJUSTE, et qui ne semble difficile qu'en aspect parce qu'il est injuste. Il est injuste sur bien plus d'aspect que ses combats et son exploration.\n\nMême dans le hub du village, tu peux perdre du temps parce que le seul slot utilisable pour un personnage est occupé (Que fais un prêtre dans une maison close d'ailleurs ?) ou des fois juste tes personnages décident de... ne pas revenir après leurs soins ? Ce qui force l'adaptation d'accord, mais ce qui peut aussi forcer de créer des équipes sans aucune synergie et qui ont plus de chance de prendre cher juste parce que encore une fois le jeu en a décidé ainsi ?\n\nJe peux accepter de devoir me préparer pour aller dans un donjon, d'accord. Je peux accepter de théoriser des builds ou quoi qui marchent mieux dans certains endroits mieux que d'autres. \n\nEnfin, je peux accepter que l'aléatoire dans les rogue-like peut annihiler une run et que ça fait partie du jeu. \n\nSauf que là, il ne s'agit pas de JUSTE relancer une run et tant pis. Là, il s'agit de refaire XP l'équipe, de leur racheter du matériel, et donc en fait refaire tout ce procédé chiant en boucle dans les mêmes premiers donjons pour avoir une autre chance de continuer, et encore une fois ce n'est qu'une chance parce que tu n'es pas à l'abri d'un wipe complètement indépendant de ta volonté et de ta connaissance de jeu. Et de ce que j'ai vu, plus tu progresses, et plus c'est pire.\n\nPour résumer, ce jeu avec tout son aléatoire récompense les joueurs patients et non les bon joueurs. Même si la connaissance de jeu est importante évidemment, le fait que 90% des systèmes du jeu soient régit par de l'aléatoire rend l'expérience frustrante et injuste, mais pas difficile comme beaucoup de gens le pensent.\n\nCe qui le rend, malgré l'emballage vraiment attrayant, sans aucun intérêt. Ce n'est pas un bon jeu, il détruit votre progression de manière complètement arbitraire, et vous force à refaire du grind et des choses que vous avez déjà vu pour retourner dans un contenu que vous ne connaissez pas encore.\n\nMais surtout une chose le rend très mauvais.\n\n[h2] C'est qu'il a été designé comme un jeu frustrant, et non comme un jeu difficile. [/h2]\n\nFortement déconseillé. Il y a d'autres jeux de ce type qui sont bien meilleurs, et surtout, véritablement difficiles mais justes.\n\n[h2] Unfair Dungeon [/h2]\n", "author_steamid": "76561198335771417", "author_num_games_owned": 76, "author_num_reviews": 39, "author_playtime_forever": 410, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 410, "author_last_played": "2025-02-16T19:56:23+00:00"}

Everything about it feels right though some classes such as antiquarian feel..lacking. But most of them are well balanced and can bring a lot to the table if used right and the mod support for this game is also extremely well done and easy to do. The game is hard but not so hard as to think impossible and as long as it is played smartly you can overcome any challenge the game throws at you but if you are too greedy your characters will die so knowing when to retreat and just run is of essence. The storyline is a bit hard to understand unless you read the notes scattered around the various dungeons but the world building is done extremely well with lots of diverse enemies for you to face off against in various locations, the trinkets are well done, the quirk and stress system are well thought out though I would have loved if it had a little more.. depth let's just say. For example to have like a relationship mechanic among characters like in dd2 where they can become friends, lovers, enemies etc. and see them talking to one another, having more slice of life content with your characters such as seeing them buy weapons, interact with one another during their free time, have like an opinion of you as the player based on the actions that you take and depending on that give buffs, debuffs and things of this sort so that you can build and forge a bond with the ones you recruit and start seeing them as actual people and not just simple NPCs that whether alive or dead doesn't matter as they're replaceable. Having this type of content would actually make you feel bad if they were to die as you would get to know their thoughts, feelings, hobbies etc. and get to understand them as a person not just what they can do in terms of combat and you could tie it extremely well with the quirk mechanic for example if suffering from imposter syndrome quirk for him to actually express that like 'I feel that the skin I wear is not my own, as if one day I just woke up and inhibited this vessel of madness and am now stuck living a life not my own' while going out to have a drink with him at the tavern or something like that to tell you about himself. But overall the game is fantastic and i'd give it like a 9.25/10, a must play for any dark fantasy strategy game enjoyer, the only thing holding it back for me are the sense of detachment it makes you feel towards the characters inadvertently by not delving more into the aspects I had mentioned earlier.

After all, the equipment they're carrying is far too expensive and valuable to waste.

How well you master this management aspect of the game will make the difference between your party fighting like a group of Doomslayers or just shivering, pathetic, monster bait.

LOVELY RIGHT????) and he/she or it saves the day by becoming powerfull!\r\n\r\nIGNORING all that B O R I N G rant, I'll highlight some things that made me fell in love with the game:\r\n\r\n1.- The Narrator: his voice makes me feel *waaays* and i'm straight, the work he did inspired me to try voice acting (I haven't actually done anything but welpies) and he fits so perfectly with the whole theme of the game. I love his snarky comments while in battle and how much of a dick he is, he is the definition of \"The Florida MAN\".\r\n\r\n2.- The quirky characters (Not all but my personal favorites):\r\n    * Crusader: He is a crusader man, what else can i tell you???\r\n    * Jester: Imagine dying to music\r\n    * Houndmaster: cute doggo\r\n    * Vestal: Too horny to die\r\n    * Shieldbreaker: nightmares that can kill you\r\n\r\n3.- The CUNTS that ruin your day: Their desings are  on point, the swine and the spooky skellies are my favorites.\r\n\r\nAnyway that's all from me, buy this game if you ever have the time and money and don't get too mad if you loose a good character, don't get to attached.", "author_steamid": "76561199113433509", "author_num_games_owned": 0, "author_num_reviews": 3, "author_playtime_forever": 6948, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 6794, "author_last_played": "2025-11-07T21:56:56+00:00"}

That being said I had fun returning to the game and steamrolling many of the enemies that had given me grief on my first go.\r\n\r\nI am currently on my third playthrough and unfortunately by this time I have experienced many more experimental and creative rpgs and it no longer keeps my interest as it used. I still love this game and adore its character and game design and I have incorporated the mechanics into many of my own RPG and TRPG designs.\r\n\r\nTLDR: Had a great time on my first play through\r\nSecond play through: was good but pacing issues become stronger\r\nThird play through: Still love the game but find it harder to enjoy like I used to.\r\n\r\nI recommend playing this game particularly if you are a fan of dark-fantasy turn-based rpgs.

Immediately, I imagined this as an enemy party, the kids as maggots, the adult as the backline tank - the wendigo. My frontline dps dealer (my hands) went to work as I demolished the 2 front kids with my cleave attack, yelling \"MY LEPER NEVER MISSES.\" The rest of the enemy party was clearly surprised by my attack, given their horror. I then proceeded to pellet the other two with stun (my roundhouse kicks) until they fell to the ground. The big one put their hands up in the air, as if to plead for mercy. It was too late for any lingering sympathy, so alas I gave them a final lesson. \"Monstrous size has no intrinsic merit, unless inordinate exsanguination be considered a virtue.\"", "author_steamid": "76561199169104566", "author_num_games_owned": 0, "author_num_reviews": 1, "author_playtime_forever": 12390, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 127, "author_playtime_at_review": 4660, "author_last_played": "2026-01-25T05:09:07+00:00"}

To people just starting out, it can seem baffling, unfair, and deliberately obscure. To people who have been playing since Early Access, and who have seen favourite party compositions and strategies rendered obsolete, the Steam reviews page is more of an extension of Reddit than anything else - a place to air grievances (legitimate or otherwise) over a game that they have dedicated a lot of time to.\n\nWhat a lot of these reviews miss out is... y'know... the actual review part. On that front, I would say the following: the core gameplay is rock solid. At its heart, Darkest Dungeon has taken a minimalist, turn-based, four-man combat system and imbued it with massive potential for tactical thought and personal flair. Figuring out the best role for each of your heroes (chosen from a fairly generous pool of classes) and suddenly realising a unique way of getting them to synergise is immensely gratifying. Unlike a lot of games, it doesn't feel like there is a a ring-fenced area of \"correct\", vanilla play that only the very high-level players can get past; instead, you are encouraged and rewarded for coming up with your own strategies from the get go. The central combat system is smart, it pushes you to experiment, and there is a lot of room to come up with a playstyle that feels like your own, unique creation.\n\nHOWEVER! If that's all Darkest Dungeon was, it would be a neat tablet-based distraction, but ultimately sterile. It is the stuff that comes layered on top of it that is the source of its intrigue - and also the source of a lot of the frustration you'll see directed at it. As a typical RPG player, you naturally do everything you can to guarantee the safety and efficacy of your character(s), and it feels inherently uncomfortable to work in a game environment that leaves you perpetually on your toes and at risk of failure. DD refuses to let you settle into a comfortable routine, and a massive enemy critical attack, an ambush in pitch-dark while camping, or a series of misses on your part can topple you from a seemingly-unassailable position to a very desperate one. The potential for a fail-cascade is what turns off many new players, and even drives experienced ones to the occasional rage-review, but it is also vital to the fundamental risk-reward balance of the game, which is designed to punish complacency and encourage the utmost thought on your part.\n\nAs you progress through a dungeon, you constantly need to balance a dwindling supply of light, food, sanity and health (although they can be restored in some ways), while also trying to complete objectives and collect much-needed loot with limited backpack space. Usually, this is the sort of gameplay I dislike; feeling that there is a time-limit, that I can't plough through something at my own speed in relative safety, is an uncomfortable experience after most games. However, the actual result is some very effective tension. In a normal RPG (say... Diablo), the steady drip of ever-increasing numbers is satisfying in a functional sort of way, but in DD the stakes are so high that getting a critical hit or dodging a huge attack always feels like a [i] moment [/i] rather than just a nice bonus. \n\nIt can initially feel punishing and unfair, since most gamers are hard-wired to see a hero death (which is permanent), a catastrophic turn-around, or a \"tactical retreat\" as a failure. Likewise, the element of randomness can make it feel like your hard work and smart play has not been rewarded, like you're just a random collection of atoms buzzing around in a meaningless void where there is no God or higher authority to dispense justice or distinguish right or wrong.... It takes time to realise that you were never [i] meant [/i] to have it easy, that it's [i] always [/i] been a gamble, and you can't expect a perfect S ranking - all you can do is make the best play you can with the information you have. It takes time to realise that the game is pushing you to accept loss and difficulty as part of the game, rather than a failure.\n\n Even I rage quit every now and then - but I always come back, because, as I said, Darkest Dungeon is an emotional game. You invest (real) time and (fake) money in your group of heroes, the odds are massively stacked in the House's favour, none of your guys is going to come out unscarred, you are going to face some serious setbacks, but you return because actually making it, actually landing that last hit at the last possible moment, realising you've scraped through again, is always a surprise, and an amazing one at that.", "author_steamid": "76561197971906267", "author_num_games_owned": 0, "author_num_reviews": 3, "author_playtime_forever": 29213, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 11356, "author_last_played": "2021-02-26T13:12:52+00:00"}

Don't expect to always win, or that everyone will always survive. Somebody will eventually die, somebody will eventually go insane, and after that there's just more of that. This games throws whatever it can to make you lose, and even if you win the biggest of fights you won't always be able to win in the end. Why? Because this game takes planning and thinking forward to the extreme, and it will trick you into overextending in some way just so that you will die. And that's great.\n\nThe game itself, being an RPG, has many stats and many mechanics that interact in one way or another with everything else. Then why draw a point to it? Because you must NEVER, EVER underestimate or overestimate those values. The fact that an attack has 80% of hit chance vs a 95% hit chance is huge in the early levels, and as you go up in difficulty those rifts keep getting bigger and bigger, specially when you can find enemies in the early levels with evasion as high as 25. It means you need to plan for it. The fact that an enemy can inflict stress damage to your party, that it can protect another enemy, and that it has particular resistances to certain status can change drastically your aproach to each encounter, and the fact that depending on where you're going you will be facing a specific group of enemies plus some more generic ones. It means you need to plan for it. The fact that you can specialize certain classes to be more oriented towards a particular role (most of the time) and that you have only so much money at hand to do so, and that you need to divide it between that, buying better gear so that they won't die (and further specialize them) and keeping them sane. It means you need to plan for it. If nothing else, this game is a game about planning as carefully as you can, letting as little to chance as you can. Because the more you leave up to chance, the higher the chances something will wipe you out, or that you'll drive yourself into a corner you may not want to go into. \n\nBut then again, as many other reviewers have said, the game gets too hard if you care too much about all of your characters. Having to take care of a roster of up to 26 someway-or-another twisted people can only get you so far, and you won't always be able to keep them safe or have enought money to do so. It is ultimately your choice if you wish to stop caring about everyone but the ones you like the most, or if you wish to go as far a you can trying to veil for both your interests and your whole party's safety. \n\nAlso, you must learn about everything anything in the game can do, and plan accordingly to that, ALWAYS TAKING INTO ACCOUNT WHAT HAPPENS IF EVERYTHING GOES WRONG. If you knows there are enemies that aren't weak to a specific kind of ailment, don't take too many characters that rely on that kind of ailment to do their stuff. If you know an enemy can heal or deal more damage than another, priotize getting rid of either it or the next biggest threat there is besides it. If you know your characters have quirks or traits that affect them in certain scenarios, take those too into account when choosing your party and where to go, if not also how much stuff to take to that mission. If you're trying to kill a enemy that is quite devastating but it can evade everything you throw at him, don't always try to kill it with everything if you are leaving more vulnerable targets that you can kill with less effort stacking up bits of damage against you. Every action, every health, every miss, every hit, every fight and every event inside the dungeons can make a huge difference when stacked. So try to always think over what's the optimal way of doing stuff and, if you don't want to get everyone killed, when you're far enough gone that your only reasonable option is to run away. Luck can be in your favor, but never try to abuse it.\n\nYes. Darkest Dungeon is unfair. Everything can kick your ass if you get caught in the wrong spot, if luck screws you over, or if you try to do more than you can. But if you really want to apreciate it, you must deal with every loss and every death, every failed resolve check and every loss, and learn from it. Try to learn how much is too much, how little is too little, what corners can be cut and what corners cannot. Learn what works with what and what doesn't. And if you really don't want to lose, don't feel bad if you need to go to the wikia to check on what will be expecting you on your next mission. Knowledge, and knowing how to use it properly, is the only thing you can rely on this game, and if you don't want the frustrating trial-and-error you need to get it, no shame in getting it from someone else. It's not as if it tells you everything, but starting from it as a basis and then piling up experience will get you to \"know\" the game, to really \"feel\" when things will go wrong, and if you can deal with a particular situation.\n\nIn conclusion, Darkest Dungeon is really hard, but it can be a rewarding experience. It is opressive by design, since that's how Red Hook wanted it to feel like, just so that every little victory you get is ever the sweetest, and every failure, if you learn from it, a word on caution and the knowledge on how lessen the chances of it repeating itself. Only get it if you think you can deal with stuff not always going according to plan, no matter how well crafted if may be, and getting crushed by letting minuscule things piling up. Those are the bread and butter of the game until you start to get the hang of how to manage those situations, and the real enjoyment of the game (besides maybe a bit of masochism) can only be gotten after it...even if luck can screw you over.\n\nPD: Get mods if you can. Not all of them may be or seem good enough, but all of them add something interesting enough to the game.\n\n", "author_steamid": "76561198099623766", "author_num_games_owned": 0, "author_num_reviews": 29, "author_playtime_forever": 4026, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 3646, "author_last_played": "2019-06-11T01:54:16+00:00"}

Let me tell you:  THIS IS NOT DARK SOULS.\n\nI get it, you like hard games which rely on perfect timings and knowledge of the individual frames each move takes up.  This isn't that sort of game.  It's difficult, but it's strategically difficult.  You will always have time to think over your decisions before you make them.  This also means that in order to prevent there always being one perfect move, there is an element of RNG in this game.  Some people enjoy it, some people hate it, some people use it as an excuse for losing.  I hate to break it to you, but if you're losing you're probably making poor decisions.  Just because you lowrolled an occultist heal and that caused a character to die doesn't mean you lost to RNG.  Maybe you went for damage instead of throwing out a stun.  Maybe you didn't bring any stuns.  There are many decisions that go into every consequence in this game, and although you might think you are playing perfectly, you're probably not.  I know I make mistakes quite often.\n\nSo take a moment on this game, give it a try.  Remember: an element of RNG does not mean your decisions don't matter.

Not exactly inviting to a casual audience, but while fights are brutal and can turn on their head with a single bad idea or coin flip, almost nothing is a permanent loss. Despite often being regarded as a \"rogue-like\", there is no fail state unless you're playing on the hardest difficulty(don't, it's for loonies). Losing battles can be abandoned, recovered from and attempted later. Lost equipment can be reclaimed. Lost heroes can be replaced, but never forgotten.\n\nLike any moderately difficult game, failure is an important part of success, and as such you probably need a good sense of humor about cascade failure and getting screwed over to properly enjoy this game.\nOver time you'll form strategies to effectively counter the painful RNG.\nRNG is present in most any RPG, but in most cases it's fairly easy to ignore.\nIn Darkest Dungeon, it's an emotional rollercoaster and one of the greatest dividers of opinion, because combat is fast(as a turn-based game can be) and harsh, victory never assured even with the best odds.\nThe game tells you right away that it's about making the best of bad situations, and that is it exactly.\nThere is no describing the feeling of missing an 80% accuracy swing for the third turn in a row, being crit'ed to 0 HP(not death, by the way) and for the healer to then crit heal for 0 HP.\nLeper and Occultist for life.\nPersonally this makes the game for me.\nThis is far from being the kind of RNG where you just hit the same button repeatedly until it works. Strategy is very important and very satisfying. The game is long and repetitive, however, and this controlled chaos means that fighting the same enemies with the same party for the fiftieth time could result in any number of wild cards demanding improvisation.\n\nOn that note, the other divisive part of the game is grindiness.\nI actually don't regard it as very grindy, though it's probably a mentality thing.\nI hate grind. I have finished a whopping one JRPG in my life because of it.\nThe difference here is that the combat is the whole point of Darkest Dungeon, whatever progress that comes with it being a secondary motivator. Most of the time I hardly care if I get the items I need for the thing or whatever, and just want to do another run to see how this new formation holds up in different situations.\nIt is far from succinct, though. A full playthrough on the standard difficulty can easily take over 100 weeks(1 quest = 1 week) if you take your time with learning and building up resources.\n\nSound is also worth a mention.\nThe music and narrator can get slightly old over time, being a little dramatic for situations that grow increasingly familiar, but that time sure doesn't come fast.\nThe music is distinctive and heightens the anxiety when the going gets rough, my favorite part being that it changes, growing louder and with new sounds mixed in as your torch starts to go out.\nThe narrator, voiced by Wayne June, is unforgettable. He's done a lot of good work on audiobooks, including Lovecraft stories, and he brought all that good juice in for his deliveries of the strange and dire lines about mortality and cosmic horrors.\n\nDumb footnote, but it probably improved my opinion a bit that it's a game from this decade that I can run on my trash laptop.\nIt's very light on requirements.\n\ntl;dr(wouldn't blame you, pardon the rambles)\nVery recommended, but consider what you're personally willing to put up with.", "author_steamid": "76561198001730788", "author_num_games_owned": 0, "author_num_reviews": 5, "author_playtime_forever": 11206, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 3815, "author_last_played": "2023-07-13T21:43:33+00:00"}

And trust me, RNG will ruin your day.\n\nThe game doesn’t just present you with bad situations—it dumps you in them. Constantly.

If anything, it’s a “question your life choices and wonder why you thought this was a good idea” kind of game.\n\nIt’s a masterpiece in creating atmosphere, tension, and despair. But at the same time, it’s depressing and constantly disappointing.

YOu recruit heroes, send them into dungeons on mission and hope they survive. The missions and layouts of the dungeons are more or less randomized as are their contents. Death is permanent. And that will be counted as a mercy.\n\nThe unique mechanic of this game is the Stress (not sanity) meter, the afflictions/virtues, and quirks. Mental health is just as important as physical health and as your heroes areexposed to the terrible eldrich horros and abominations that make mockery of flesh and form, they will slowly but surely go insane.  Once a hero takes a certain amount of stress damage they will become afflicted by varuiouus conditions. This can have varying effects from causing erratic statuses, actions, and in somecases causing them to attack other heroes.\n\nAfter missions your heroes will develop quirks. Some beneficial that ad bonuses, but most will be negative that make heroes weaker. The more missions a hero goes on the more experience and levels they gains but also the more of these quirks they pick up.  Stress and  these quirks can be treated of course, for a hefty fee.\n\nTough choices will have to be made.\n\nOne of the best things is that the devs do regullarly return to add new content.

Learn to cut and run and use the resources you gained to upgrade your various systems in town to better maintain the next batch of troops.

While I don't want to get into that, if you want, you can absolutely find information about it.\n\nNow that the game is released, you may have seen a certain top review, I urge you to look at his time played in the last two weeks (which includes the time since the game was actually released), and notice that he has not played the game since the release, which means he cannot say whether or not the content has improved. He has been attacking the game for months, and was (as far as I can tell) initially enraged by the fact that the devs were not interested in incorporating his opinion into their artistic vision, please keep this in mind when considering your purchase.\n\nThis game is amazing, and I've been playing since early summer. It has come incredibly far, and anyone who says otherwise is making snap judgements, or flat out lying. Darkest Dungeon has XCOM levels of difficulty. It has XCOM level \"WTF\" moments. Occasionally you will miss 99% chance to hit attacks, and occasionally enemies will get nigh impossible critical strings. But just like XCOM, through base building and experience, you can minimize risk and become a force to be reckoned with. \n\nThis game is challenging, but not nearly as hard as most negative reviews would lead you to believe. Most of them say things like \"The devs have been trying to remove every winning strategy\" or \"the game is anti-fun now\", but in reality, I haven't met any players new to the game that have problems with it. This leads me to believe that throughout the development of the game, players found certain strategies that were drastically over-powered (which is why in the discussion boards, there are players that rant about the game being too easy), and the devs introduced changes which reduced the efficacy of these imbalanced strategies (which in any other game would be considered a \"balance patch\", but apparently in this game, people think it is intended to be \"fun-killing\"). One of these strategies (early on) was to get 4 of the same class, and use the exact same attack every turn until you won everything. This is no longer possible. This seems like a reasonable balance patch to me.\n\nI'm really disappointed that I have to write this review in this fashion. There is no reason I should be justifying the game against the recent torrent of bad reviews. This is an amazing game for anyone who likes strategy and/or Lovecraft. I have 300+ hours for a reason, you might not get that much time out of it, but for context, out of the current 3 difficulty tiers of dungeons, I didnt hit level 2 until 80ish hours. I really hope you give this game a chance.\n\nEdit: Due to some feedback, I would like to make something clear, this game is not XCOM. It does not have XCOM's production value or quality, and it is not worth 60 dollars. It is certainly worth it's current price tag, and buying it on sale is a no brainer.\n\nRelease Edit: Now that the game is out, I can say that the devs really came through, they added a huge number of improvements and content with the final release. I recommend this game 100%, and it will only get better from here, as there are free content updates scheduled for the next few months.", "author_steamid": "76561198026425098", "author_num_games_owned": 774, "author_num_reviews": 40, "author_playtime_forever": 20980, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 18904, "author_last_played": "2023-01-15T02:17:18+00:00"}

Here's why: because I would very, very highly recommend this game... to a certain breed of gamer. Let me explain.\n\nFirst, the good.\n\n[i]Darkest Dungeon[/i] is a masterfully crafted game. The artwork is beautifully grotesque and animation is smooth. The game is balanced fairly well, even if it is balanced towards the \"hard\" end of the spectrum. Even in early access there is nothing about this game that feels sloppy or poorly considered.\n\nThe stress mechanic, in which your characters accumulate stress which can affect them in various negative (and sometimes even positive) ways, is a really interesting idea and something that you don't really see a whole lot in video games. The only place I've seen anything like this before would be the [i]Cthulhu[/i] games, and I honestly feel like it's handled a lot better here.\n\nOh, and the fact that it's constantly auto-saving, while intended to prevent save-scumming, also has the effect of allowing you to quit and pick back up whenever you want without losing progress, great for people who don't have a lot of time to sit down and play a game.\n\nThe game wasn't my cup of tea (I'll get to why in a minute) but I can't honestly call it bad just because of that. It's not bad. In fact...\n\n[b]KR Rating: [5] GREAT[/b]\n\nBut wait, don't stop reading yet, because now it's time for the bad. As I said before, [i]Darkest Dungeon[/i] is a hard game.\n\nWell, no, that's not really accurate. [i]Etrian Odyssey[/i] is hard. That's why I like that series, and it's why I thought I would like this game too. [i]Darkest Dungeon[/i] is not hard, it's unfair.\n\nSee, you can be riding high one minute, dominating every encounter and getting a ton of good items from the various chests and cupboards (called \"curios\" in the game) that litter the dungeons. Then you get into that one battle. You know the one I mean. It's the one that doesn't even seem like it should be all that hard. It's the same enemies you've been wasting with ease this whole time. Except this time you do nothing but miss your attacks over and over, while they stack critical hit upon critical hit. Before you can even click the \"retreat\" button half your force is at Death's Door... or through it. It's a little like [i]Dark Souls[/i] in a way.\n\nAnd the thing is, that's not an accident. I said this game was masterfully crafted and it honestly is. This isn't poor game balance, it's the entire point. It's the underlying design philosophy of the game.\n\nThe developers never intended this to be a game where you train up max level badasses and retake the estate.  There are no badasses in the [i]Darkest Dungeon[/i]. There are no heroes.\n\nNo, this is a game where you recruit expendable idiots by the wagon-load (literally) and send them to die for the greater good. (This is also why there are so few levels of upgrades for your characters: so that restarting when your top character dies is easier.)\n\nThat's why I say, I really wish that Steam allowed more options than just \"recommend\" or \"not recommend.\" Because, on the one hand, the game is very well made. It has become exactly what I feel the developers wanted it to be. It is a GREAT GAME.\n\nBut \"great\" and \"universally enjoyable\" are not the same thing. A lot of people don't like hard games. I do like hard games and even I was turned off by the unfairness and the inability to properly take care of my people.\n\nIf I really had to choose (and for the purposes of the Steam version of this review I kind of do) I would say that I don't recommend the game, if only because I think the number of people who would enjoy it are in the minority.\n\nThat said, if you're the type who thinks you might enjoy that then by all means buy the game right now. It's only $19.99 USD on Steam right now, and for that you get one Hell of a solid classic-style RPG with an interesting twist.\n\nIf you're more like me and you get attached to your characters and don't want to see them die (or if you just don't like hard games) then skip this one.\n\n([url=http://knightlyreviews.blogspot.com/2015/10/video-game-review-darkest-dungeon.html]Read the review on Knight's Reviews by clicking here.[/url])", "author_steamid": "76561198038659734", "author_num_games_owned": 0, "author_num_reviews": 24, "author_playtime_forever": 622, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 581, "author_last_played": "2015-10-01T09:12:10+00:00"}

Naturally, I dismissed it, thinking that I'm going to do better. 150 hours later, I'll say this instead: This is a great game, with some design choices which accentuate the futility of the fight against the unspeakable. In other words, your carefully trained and equipped heroes will die - inglorious, meaningless deaths. That's what it means to stand against the eldritch.\n\n\"Big deal\", you probably think. \"The game clearly states in its trailer:  all that awaits you is madness and death. What did you expect? Also, how is it any different from any other hard game where you die a lot?\" Fair point. Let me explain, but let's take a look at something else first.\n\n[h1]Venerable opulence[/h1]\nThe first thing you see when you look at this game is the general feel. And let me tell you: it gets much, much better than that. The symphony of the look, the music and the narration is mesmerising. The way it compliments and reacts to the gameplay is nothing short of fantastic. The battle music changes depending on your torch level, which is a self-imposed risk-reward mechanic (the darker it gets, the more violent and dangerous the fight is, but you get better loot). The narrator reacts to almost everything that happens, either foretelling your upcoming doom, congratulating your character on a crit, reminding you to not get too cocky. Wayne June is doing Elder God's work - his voice acting is easily 30-40% of the game's appeal. On an unrelated note, check out his readings of Lovecraft.\n\nWhat I'm saying here is: the game excels at luring you in. You want to explore, you want to cleanse, you want to find more riches to expand your town, strengthen your heroes and to go fight nastier and nastier abominations. And so you continue.\n\n[h1]Triumphant pride[/h1]\nAfter a while, you get good at it. You start understanding how positioning works, how stats interact, which classes work well together. You begin to understand which classes compliment each other and what team compositions work against which areas and enemies. You will probably lose a few dear heroes. But that's alright, every death is a lesson learned. You know which situations call for pressing on, and which situations are unsalvageable and demand retreat. Risk management is a constant companion here. \n\nYou use your newfound skills to cleanse the areas of the game. To defeat bosses, which are interesting and unique, if challenging, encounters. You'll probably hit roadblocks, will be forced to rethink your strategy. Sometimes you will lose just because fate (RNG) said so. But this is all acceptable. Eventually, you push through, and emerge victorious.\n\n[h1]Dizzying fall[/h1]\nAt this point I should mention that in order to level your characters you need two things: gold and experience. Gold buys you better gear - which is mandatory later on, as it also affects things like dodge or accuracy - and experience, well, levels your guys up. Characters at certain levels can only go on expeditions suited to their level. If it's too easy for them, they will flat out refuse to go. If it's too hard, they will gain additional stress and probably get massacred anyway. As such, you have to constantly keep teams of people available and have high-level reserves, because if someone needs to recover from an expedition or, worst case, dies, you must plug the hole somehow. \n\nPoint is: levelling people is hard. It's a very grindy process. High level champion with gear is worth their weight in gold. Which is why the final dungeon is such a stab in the heart.\n\n[h1]Darkest Dungeon[/h1]\nThere are three things to note about the final expedition. First, it contains completely new, original, and very difficult enemies. You need to learn to fight them. You will lose just by virtue of trial and error, and even fully powered heroes feel underlevelled. Second, once a hero has entered the dungeon once, they will never again be able to enter due to sheer terror. As such, you have to make every expedition count. Third, there is no escape. Up until now retreat was always an option, but here if you try to escape one of your heroes will randomly die to cover for the rest.\n\nCombine this with the fact that every single hero that is even allowed to enter must have maxed out level and stats and maybe you can begin to see the sheer magnitude of grind required to even \"git gud\", much less succeed - as stated before, sometimes you just can't win because of circumstances. And that's okay, or at least it would've been if the price of failure wasn't so exorbitant.\n\n[h1]The end, such as it is[/h1]\nIt's such a shame. I really loved this game. Even while writing this my heart races as I think of the great expeditions I had. But in the end I decided I simply do not have the patience, time, or will to grind out yet another batch of fodder for the final expedition. I like to think that this is the point the game set out to make - you can't fight the eldritch. I am sure there are people who have succeeded. In the end, with patience and luck you probably can beat the game. But I can't.\n\nI have descended into madness instead.\n", "author_steamid": "76561198026663817", "author_num_games_owned": 1175, "author_num_reviews": 457, "author_playtime_forever": 8866, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 8866, "author_last_played": "2019-10-31T14:50:58+00:00"}

Be prepared to experience the consensus \"cons\"; which can be blisteringly frustrating in the early game.  If you think those things will be enough to trump the enjoyment you would get from the things the game does well, do not purchase it.\n\nThe most common criticisms of Darkest Dugeon are the inability to turn off combat animations, combat speed, dialogue animations causing you to be unable to interact with anything until completed, and RNG.  All of these things exist in varying degrees.\n\nCombat animations + dialogue have the potential to draw combat out for far too long.  The animations themselves, while cool, can start to feel really repetitive if you're having a bad stroke of RNG (missing a lot, despite a high chance to hit).  They also are very herky-jerky (there's a zoom during an animation) that leaves me feeling like I'm rocking on a boat.  If I play on an empty stomach, sometimes I feel slightly nauseous.\n\nThe chat bubbles also leave something to be desired.  They become repetitive very quickly and interupt the flow of exploration and combat.  I suspect they were included to create atmosphere, but I find they actually detract from it because of how herky-jerky they become - this causes your immersion to be regularly broken up/halted.  This is typically only an issue if your party is afflicted by negative quirks or your torchlight is dimming.  Characters become more talkative when things are going poorly.\n\nRNG.  I originally wrote that I didn't find this particularly irritating and chalked up the experience to most people just being unfamiliar with game mechanics (IE Chance to Hit, Resistances, etc).  I've chosen to recant that.  RNG is crippling, but only in the early game.  Darkest Dungeon's biggest  problem, in my opinion, is the early vs late game balance.  Early on, resources are tight.  You don't have a ton of gold that can afford you to recoup your losses if you have to abandon a mission.  You don't have a town that has been upgraded to reduce the cost of removing negative quirks/high stress levels.  Due to this, you often feel overwhelmed - particularly if you have a bad stroke of RNG (IE. You get crit multiple times early in a dungeon, multiple characters have very high stress levels from it, etc).  Later in the game, once you've upgraded your town some, prices aren't has crippling (maybe 750-1000 gold instead of 1500) AND you're getting more money from missions.  In addition, you might be able to remove quirks from 2 characters at a time, instead of just one.  As the game progresses, you almost start to feel overpowered - not in the traditional sense, as things can still go terribly wrong, but when compared to your early experience where EVERY thing feels stressful.\n\nGetting crit increases stress by 15-20.  Landing a crit reduces stress by 5-10.  Therein lies many of the inherent problems in every facet of this game.  When something goes wrong it is always nearly TWICE as punishing as the beneficial aspect of something going right.  \n\nMy personal biggest qualm has to be the lack of an easy way to discern combat attack order.  There exists a \"SPD\" stat, which I assume is speed and I also assume determines attack order.  Rifling through each monsters' stat in an effort to figure out what will be attacking when is not an intuitive, efficient, or easy system.  It also feels like the order isn't static, as the encounter progresses the same monster isn't always attacking in the same spot (or so it seems - I could be incorrect in this claim).  The reason this is problematic is because it forces you to pay astronomically close attention/have an excellent memory of when something attacked to determine whether you should disable (stun) or gamble for a kill (powerful regular attack).  This becomes further complicated when trying to \"combo\" attacks.  IE. Stun with a character so another class that has an attack with a dmg increase against stunned targets can eliminate it.  Since combat positioning matters, if I stun, then my character gets pushed into a different position, and the new position renders me unable to use my bonus dmg against stunned targets attack, I have essentially wasted that initial action.\n\nBeyond some of these troubling mechanics, most of which I foresee being tweaked to be less punishing/better tuned, the game has some very neat features.  Stress, while annoying to some, was a big selling point for me.  I would like to see stress become more balanced around fight/flight.  What I mean by that is, currently, it feels like the vast majority of stress mechanics are negative.  Indeed, I would say upwards of 80% of the time my characters have become stressed they have suffered negative mechanics as opposed to positive.  I would like to see this number brought closer to 50/50.  Not to get too invested in \"real life\" comparisons, since this game is hardly reminscent of \"real life\", but stress serves a pretty strong evolutionary purpose and definitely is not something that is 80% negative (even if it has been shown to reduce your life span).  The same could be said of what happens when you \"gamble\" on opening chests/sarcophagus.  It feels, more often than not, like this is a greater risk than potential reward.\n\nCombat positioning and class synergy are very cool.  Unfortunately, I don't think they are explained in a proficient way for new players which leaves one floundering in the dark for quite some time.  This type of trial and error experience feels a little bit exhausting.  Perhaps the addition of a tutorial or \"practice\" mode that has some examples of \"combos\" would be helpful.  IE. a guide that says, \"Try using class X ability Y following using class Z ability T\".  \n\nThe town is also neat.  The availability of upgrades makes it highly customizable and meaningful.  Much like the class system and synergy, though, it can feel quite confusing and overwhelming.  Resources are definitely finite early on and with so many different options and features to upgrade, I have often felt at a bit of a loss.  Discerning what is important in the early game versus what can be ignored until resources start to become plentiful in the late game is extremely difficult.\n\nI've heard some argue that upgrading character abilities and weapons/armor doesn't feel worth it for the cost.  I whole-heartedly disagree.  Upgrades are ABSOLUTELY worth it.  Sure, your damage doesn't go up astronomically, but your accuracy does.  Accuracy, to me, is probably the most important stat.  Also, they aren't that pricey as long as you invest in reducing cost - something that I think people aren't doing.\n\nClass balance could be improved.  There are a few classes that just feel worthless when compared to their counterparts.  I think both Plague Doctor and Leper are worthless.  Jester, other than people abusing their \"stress heal\" mechanic, leaves a lot to be desired as well.\n\nUltimately, this game is really about two phases of gameplay.  Early game is soul-crushing and you feel like a victim to every mechanic.  When I read negative reviews, I can see why people are frustrated.  Early game can be THAT frustrating.  Frustrating to the point of wanting to smash your keyboard against the wall.  Most of these things are resolved by mid-late game, though.  If you survive early game, Darkest Dungeon opens up and becomes incredibly fun.  My hope is we will see some tuning regarding early versus late game.  I suspect we will.\n\nIf you don't think early game will be too frustrating or are willing to soldier through that frustration, pick up Darkest Dungeon.  The game is done remarkably well and, despite being in an older genre, has a lot of innovation which makes it stand out from its peers.", "author_steamid": "76561198005772592", "author_num_games_owned": 0, "author_num_reviews": 16, "author_playtime_forever": 2246, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 1209, "author_last_played": "2018-03-06T00:20:50+00:00"}

PURE evil. Your heroes can and WILL die from wonderful life-like reason such as starvation, stressed till madness/heart-attack, and even just for attempting to clear an obstacle. They even give you achievements for it lol. \n+Plenty to play for; variety of hero classes, monster bosses that you gotta grind the level for, treasures/loot to improve/save the town and team, last dungeon that will slaughter you a lot till you learn).\n+The narration/voice acting is just perfect (even if it is at night and you have two babies sleeping like mine, don't tur on the screen-blocking subtitles).\n+Tactical (almost each step forces you to consider if it is wise to continue) and I had to consider who/what to bring, what to do, and how to fight for every single quest/dungeon run. There's always a pro and con to each item/hero/move, choose wisely or the cemetary will get larger.\n+Story is decent albeit short unless you concentrate on what narrator is talking all the time; I actually was interested enough to go read up the story to understand more on the ancestor and narrator.\n\nWhat's there to hate?\n\n-DAMNED RNG. I know you can plan for shit but RNG lords can always throw a frigging wrench to your plans. One missed attack = one dead hero/party. It happens, and you gotta learn to live with it else you will rage often *pray that your virtue holds lol*.\n-At times (often in my case) requires checking guide and ideas online on how to work through certain bosses. It is do-able to skip it and learn based on tips and experience but if you love your team as much as I do, to hell with dignity muahahaha.\n-Grinding...to make it worse, once you sent your best against Darkest Dungeon, they get stressed to go again (on higher difficulty, they don't even agree to go back). While you can still use them, you just lost probably your best team and I hope you have a good back-up team in mind already. Cause I didn't. ?@!#$%&*!?!\n-Reversing to clear other areas will be a pain in the arse as it forces you to reverse the all over the map at times.\n\nSummary:\n\n*Allows you to play at your own pace (you don't move, they won't too - perfect if you need to run around IRL).\n*Well-worth the money and time especially when you finally reached the last dungeon despite how bloody painful it was.

It's mostly a resource-management game, where your resources are your heroes and your cash. The game was created to make you struggle on keeping them both in the positive, thus more than half of the experience is planning ahead, measuring the risk and the potential reward, then deciding if it's worth it.\n\nThis isn't a deep, turn-based RPG where you create a party and build them in dozens of different ways to overcome anything. Your options are limited, your heroes have very powerful strengths but most of these are very situational, and that's the weakness everyone shares in this game along with stress. And yes, I also mean [b]you[/b], the player.\n\nYou will want to retreat to a safe spot. You will create a party that you think can overcome anything and once you do it, you'll want to stick with it. And in so doing, you'll lose sight of the reality of your situation. And disaster will come with it. And if you look everywhere and everyone to blame for your misdoings, then you'll be doomed to repeat your mistakes. And when you keep doing them, at one point you'll probably come here, leave a negative review justifying your short-sightedness by blaming the RNG and never, ever touch this great game again.\n\nTo succeed, you need experience. It will give you the knowledge to know which heroes work best in all dungeons, which work best in the Darkest Dungeon quests and which work best for certain bosses. It can only come by making risks that will drive your party to an early grave or succeeding by a breath's hair, then trying again. You can read guides to see which combinations work where, what tools for which dungeon, etc. The wiki is extremely generous in this regard. The RNG *will* ruin you and bring you to the verge of mental collapse because it's supposed to. Plans aren't perfect, everything can go south real fast and you need to have a contingency plan and adapt or forfeit the fight. If you continue to fight against the odds, then don't act surprised that the game tires you when you lost one-too-many heroes due to your decisions.\n\nTake it slow, have patience. You can come back, do it all over again. Failure is an option, but you decide how big of a consequence it will have on you. Your enemies are powerful, ruthless, merciless and fight on familiar grounds. So become all of that, re-discover your heritage and use your collected wisdom to adapt to the situation.

These people are wrong, and their opinions should be discarded. What Darkest Dungeon actually is, is an RNG-focused, brutally-difficult RPG where the goal is to make the best of a bad hand. And, this game does that extremely well. \n\nThe game is hard, especially at first. This is because you don't yet know how to mitigate the game's many systems that are literally designed to smack you down, hard. If you're always feeling like you're on the edge of defeat, barely making it through each mission and dealing with the aftermath; the game is working as intended. But, that does not mean the game is impossible. Slowly, but surely, you'll learn how to mitigate the RNG and oppressive systems the game throws at you. You'll start to notice patterns; what works and what doesn't. The game doesn't hide anything from you, and if you bother to read and pay attention, they aren't even all that complicated. \n\nIf you can find the fun in this initial stage of confusion, nerves, and panic, then you will find an incredible game awaits you. The atmosphere, art, voicework, and music are top-notch. The gameplay is tense, swinging heavily between triumphant and devastating at a moment's notice. The heroes are diverse and interesting, each filling their own niche and you'll start to fall in love with certain character's skills and themes. The enemies are the same; each with their own unique and dangerous moves. \n\nNo game is quite like Darkest Dungeon, so much so that many of its systems are influencing other games. If you enjoy games that are complex, but not overwhelming; punishing, but not impossible... Grab this game and its DLC. You won't regret it. 200+ hours later, I'm still enjoying booting the game up and running dungeons, and I consider it one of my top 5 games of all time. \n\nIf you're feeling frustrated, try to understand the game's systems instead of getting frustrated. Here's what I recommend:\n\n- Play your first run on Radiant mode.\n- Disable the Crimson Court DLC.\n- Disable the Color of Madness DLC.\n- Read text boxes, tutorials, hover over all the stats and numbers to try to understand the games mechanics.\n\nOnce you feel like you have a good grasp on the game's systems; once you feel like the game is getting \"too boring\", go ahead and start a new file on Darkest with all the DLC enabled. This will significantly increase the complexity and difficulty of the game, but you'll find it much easier to deal with. \n\nAnd hopefully you'll enjoy this game as much as I, and many others, have.\n\nJust remind yourself, always, that confidence is a slow, and insidious killer.", "author_steamid": "76561197983754371", "author_num_games_owned": 298, "author_num_reviews": 9, "author_playtime_forever": 17400, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 13378, "author_last_played": "2024-10-06T02:33:43+00:00"}

People have commented on the RNG of the game, how the deck feels stacked against you and how your adventurers don't feel like 'heroes' but skittering madmen and how quickly things can get out of control and the grind of recovering your loses. Yes the game 'can' get grindy at times and yes there are times when an encounter will scale so far out of control and you lose some or all adventurers, but despite what some might think this is the minority and most times it is players gambling or pushing their luck.\n\nDarkest dungeon is set almost like in a lovecraftian story, its not about heroes fighitng monsters and smiting their way to victory, it is about clawing and scrambling in an attempt to win a losing battle. The characters or adventures you hire aren't heroes, they are the dredges of the world who are either suicidal or mad enough to venture in. The first time you play you will be blind and as such you will be beaten many times, the bosses in particular are terrifying not so much because they hit hard or have a lot of health (though it doesn't help), but because the way they act or behave is so different to what you have expereinced previously in the game. You will lose characters in this game (it says it right on the box when the game loads), but you learn from your mistakes and you come back with the knowledge of your failed attempts and you succeed and that i think is one of the true enjoyments of the darkest dungeon. Its about surviving the dungeons long enough to find what holds and to exploit your foes with your new knowledge. Its like a combination of Dark souls and the game Risk, the game isn't unfair it's just not lenient and a large portion is simply knowing when to cut your losses and retreat from a dungeon instead of losing characters.\n\nFor those interested but concerend about the reviews concerning grinding or mechanics/difficulty, the game allows you to change and adjust many of its aspects. Radiant mode keeps the difficulty which speeds up adventurer XP gain, reduces gold costs and many other changes which act to reduce the grind as well as slaken some of their strict rules and in the options menu you can change other aspects as well and craft it to how you wish to play the game. Its only on the harder difficulty settings when you are forced to play by the designers rules and even then i find it more enjoyable because it adds a sense of urgency by placing you under a timer (limits how many adventures you can go on and how many adventurers can die) and makes you have to deal with unfavorable circumstances while in the other difficulty settings there is no timer and you simply need time to recover from ANY situation. This game is not for everyone and that is fine, but with the different modes, the ability to customise some mechanics you can tune it to how you wish to enjoy it.

In response to that, many players are leaving a negative review to stick it to the developer. In my humble opinion, the game itself is good. My level of information concerning the translation éclat is very superficial, but I must stress that before you believe any statements, please do the educated thing and research this topic a bit. Thanks for staying objective here, now on to the actual review.[/b][/h1]\n\nWith age, I have come to appreciate more challenging games like the Dark Souls Series. It always takes a bit of an effort, because if you want to succeed in such games, you need to deal with the mechanics and principles behind the gameplay and deepen your knowledge. My philosophy with Dark Souls was always that it was not hard in itself as long as you listened to the game's \"messages\" and acted accordingly.\n\nDarkest Dungeon is similar at heart. But the difference is that you won't reach a state of overtraining which allows you some easy farming. Instead, your heroes will refuse to go on low level missions once they have earned their wings. The conclusion is that planning is key. You need to get a mental grip on the game really fast and then plan the development of your hamlet along with the development of your heroes. And once you have accepted that the heroes are expendable, the world won't look so grim anymore!\n\nThe [b]gameplay[/b] is pretty straightforward: You have a team of four heroes, each of which comes with 4 active skills and their current equipment. You go on a mission with a clear goal and with limited resources that cost you gold for each piece you chose to take along. In combat, you have a maximum of 4v4 scenario with turn based combat. The outcomes are influenced by chance, e.g. your damage range might be 5 - 10, which would make a 10 lucky and a 5 unlucky. In that regard, it is very much like a classical RPG when it comes to stats, abilities and chance.\nSo if you have an idea of your heroes, the area and the game in general, you can plan ahead and even prevail if RNG is trying to ra...ttle you! It happens that you get wrecked, but if you learn from that experience, you wil know what to improve for the next try.\n\nWith my current expertise with the game, I'd say the [b]difficulty[/b] remains challenging and taxing even as you get stronger. There are basically 3 tiers of enemy strengths, and once your heroes reach a higher level, they need to go on higher tier missions, as previously pointed out. Gold and resources for the developtment of your hamlet are limited and you need to manage your playstyle in a way that does not leave you bankrupt after a few missions. Chosing which heroes to improve and which to let go is a part of that: Your heroes get positive and negative quirks (attribute modifiers) which can be healed or locked, as well as maladies. It's not always worth to spend your hard earned moola on a hero who has taken a wrong turn. So again, an appropriate reaction is key.\n[i]EDIT: In radiant difficulty, you can use higher level heroes for lower level missions. Yay!\nEDIT2: But you can't take Champion level heroes (5+) on lowest level missions in radiant.[/i]\n\nThe [b]artstyle[/b] is neat and the [b]sounds and music[/b] suit the theme that the game is set in. This is not a happy place game, so don't expect a cheerful tune.\n\nThe [b]game runs smoothly [/b](at least for me) and I have not yet experienced any problems or crashes. I play without any mods.\n\nI do not own the [b]DLCs[/b], so I can't comment on them. But the changes to the core game that came with the DLC seem to be reasonable. The devs have their vision of Darkest Dungeon and so they do not allow cheesing, which is fine by me. So if other reviews put that down as a negative point, then i'd wager they were too lazy to play the game the way it was intended and are now out of their depths with what they have left.\n\n\nIf you have read all the gibberish above, I would like to thank you for taking your time to read my thoughts. There is more to the game than I have written down here, but I don't need to make a dissertation out of it and I have faith that you get the idea of the game by looking at the pictures and watching the videos provided by the dev. I can really recommend Darkest Dungeon, provided that you can manage the above mentioned hurdles. It's not a game to relax and it can drive you up the walls, so don't play when you're already salty. ;)\n\n[spoiler]And if you need to cheer up, I can really really recommend the game \"Slime Rancher\" for that!

If you're the sort of person who cannot handle loss of any kind, who decries their every death in a game as bullshit, you may find this a little testing. But stick with it, learn to take a hit, and you'll find a pretty nice and cheaply priced game with fantastic aesthetics, tense duels, and a tale behind every hero.\n\nThis is a game dripping with atmosphere, the narrator grimly pronouncing the doom your heroes are charging towards, every inch of dungeon tinged with malice, and every treasure you find a possible liability down the line. The art style is fantastic, rolling with a grim aesthetic to support the grim tasks you assign to the men and women who are drawn to your banner.\n\nThe biggest issue people have with the gameplay is the RNG, but I would argue that this is misplaced. The larger issue is a lack of player agency. I’m a big fan of XCOM, and it works well as a comparison. When I play XCOM, I am given a huge amount of choices, from where to position, who to move first, which alien to target primarily, which cover to destroy, whether to get in close and shock the enemies into incompetence or to force the enemies to move to me and wear them down in a long-range engagement. In Darkest Dungeon, my options are far more limited. Each character can only have 4 abilities at any time, and it’s a lucky day when all four are available for use. And equally, the path most likely to succeed is rarely difficult to figure out. This isn’t an easy problem to fix; it’s a structural issue with the gameplay. But the limited options make it far easier for people to believe that they were simply screwed over by RNG. With more experience and time spent on a campaign, your options become more based on preparation for a mission, how much money you are willing to spend to upgrade your heroes, and which trinkets you are willing to risk to provide them with an extra edge. Even so, tactically the game degenerates into pure dice-rolling more than most would like.\n\nThis level of RNG can be enjoyable in its own way, if you choose to interpret it as individual's heroes performance. There'll always be the one front-line brawler who always crits when it's time to get serious, or a healer who insists on rolling low and sabotaging your run from the inside. There's always going to be the beaten occultist, focused down by every enemy, who finally hits 100 stress but chooses to stand tall in the face of adversity, and inspires the party to drive the beasts back. But still, for those less narratively inclined, the feeling of a run being doomed by simple chance is a hard thing to simply take in stride.\n\nStill, the game doesn’t suffer greatly for that flaw. The game is not about coming home alive every week. The one resource you cannot exhaust is fresh meat to grind against the darkness, so a death is practically part and parcel of scratching your way through the game. In fact, in one campaign that has been remarkably devoid of deaths, I have found it difficult to make room for all the new blood I needed to conquer earlier bosses. Just remember that any losses you take are no more than temporary setbacks, and there will always be more travellers ready to carry the torch further. If you pick up this game, one thing I would suggest is picking up the expanded roster mod at some point. I don’t think the roster has been expanded to handle the new classes that have been added over the game’s life, and a somewhat frustrating feature is that characters will refuse to enter lower-levelled content. It'll technically make the game slightly easier, but I'd say the trade-off is worth it to give you the ability to choose the quest you go on.\n\nGood luck and enjoyment to all those who choose to buy the game.

It has taken me almost 7 years to finish it. The main game, at least. When I first played it, it had been on Radiant. I was Not Very Good at games, and the unforgiving nature of Darkest Dungeon and my lackluster gaming skills, even on Radiant, meant that opinion turned from 'Not Very Good' to 'Oh Girl, You Are So Much Worse At This Than I Realized.' It had ended with me throwing my hands up in surrender after suffering a team wipe twice, almost in a row, first from the Shambler, and then later to Vvulf. Despite that, I resolved to one day come back and finish this damn game.\n\nAnd 7 years later, I come crawling back with gritted teeth and bloodied fingers, triumphantly better than ever before. My days of being 'Not Very Good' was over. I was now 'Eh, Acceptable.' And that was enough to fulfill a goal that was more than half a decade old by that point. On Default Difficulty, even! \n\n(I will not try it in Higher Difficulties. I know my limits. Confidence is an insidious killer, and all that.)\n\nAnyway, all that was to say, very dramatically, that I've finally finished it. Wonderful game. I absolutely love the sound effects and, of course, the narrator. It all really sets the Lovecraftian vibe the game was going for. While I was playfully complaining about the difficulty earlier, I didn't actually hate it. Struggling to be better, to improve, to overcome said difficulties made the victories all the more sweet. From what I understand, the game was purposely designed like that. It's supposed to be hard. It's supposed to be frustrating. And the challenge of it really elevated my experience playing the game.\n\nI might one day return. I still haven't defeated one of the mini bosses that made me quit the game in the first place (I Am Coming For You, Shambler). Some achievements here and there that I want to get. And, of course, the DLCs that I've been hearing good things about. \n\nTruly, one of the best games I've ever played. <3", "author_steamid": "76561198243759482", "author_num_games_owned": 0, "author_num_reviews": 1, "author_playtime_forever": 10298, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 10298, "author_last_played": "2025-01-18T05:43:11+00:00"}

Before I might have shrugged this off, assuming it was simply clever writing done to help set an ominous tone. But I’ve played enough of this game to know that this is more than just a line, it’s a warning. \n\nDarkest Dungeon is a fantastically illustrated roguelike dungeon crawler with a sense of style unlike any game I’ve ever seen before. The gothic-inspired visuals are extremely appealing and are paired perfectly with a haunting soundtrack as well as one of the best narrating voices I’ve ever heard in a game. Beyond this impeccable atmosphere and great writing there lies a game that is incredibly fun and addicting. \n\n[b] Gameplay\t[/b]\n\nThe premise of the game is simple; you have inherited the estate of a deceased relative and now must enlist the aid of various adventurers to help you explore the dungeons that lie below your land. In order to do so you must build up a network of these heroes and send them into the dungeons, four at a time, to complete various tasks. Achieving the quest at hand requires a bit of thought as you must take into account various aspects which your success hinges on. This includes your heroes, their mental and physical well-being, their equipment, and the supplies they are carrying to help aid them and keep them alive. \n\nThere are a variety of classes of heroes to choose from, each with their own unique abilities that bring a different advantage to your group. Your heroes travel through the dungeon in a line, and their placement in that line dictates what abilities they can use and what positions they can attack in the enemy’s line. You must ensure that you are using heroes that are best suited for the dungeon and/or boss you are about to face and have them arranged in a way where their abilities will not be hindered.\n\nPerhaps the most important aspect of Darkest Dungeon is the affliction system, which dictates the psychological state of your heroes. Every hero has a stress bar which displays their current stress level. If their stress level gets too high, they will respond physically to their emotional state. In rare cases this might actually give them a bonus, but in most cases it will cause a penalty which will negatively affect your chances of making it out of the dungeon alive. The stress system is not something to be ignored, and doing so will cause you to witness your otherwise healthy heroes to suffer heart attacks and die before your eyes. \n\n[b] Preparation is Key\t[/b]\n\nBefore even setting foot in a dungeon you must go through the provisions screen, where you will have the option to buy items to aid your heroes in that dungeon. It is important to pay attention to what dungeon you are going into; as certain dungeons will contain enemies that focus on a particular type of damage. By paying attention to these things you can better equip your heroes with supplies that will prove useful while saving your hard earned gold. It is worth noting that the items bought here do not carry over if you are left with a surplus at the end of the dungeon. This might be an annoyance to some, but I think it adds a bit more strategy to the game as it forces you to find a balance in how you handle your money.\n\n[b] A Difficult Journey\t[/b]\n\nWith the game saving automatically as you go along, there’s no ability to fall back on save-scumming to avoid disastrous situations. A mistake in planning can prove to be fatal, causing you to lose not only your heroes that you spent precious time leveling, but also the rare trinkets you had them equipped with. In order to avoid this heartache you will likely find yourself consulting outside sources for information about the boss you are about to face. Making an effort to think ahead and plan can help get you through some of the most difficult encounters. Progressing past the more difficult fights gives an immense feeling of success that I believe only comes with games that actually challenge you.\n\n[b] My Verdict\t[/b]\n\nI truly love this game and can’t recommend it enough to those who will not let death deter them but will instead soldier on to the next darkest dungeon.", "author_steamid": "76561198025939618", "author_num_games_owned": 1831, "author_num_reviews": 20, "author_playtime_forever": 6306, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 5401, "author_last_played": "2019-05-08T19:01:00+00:00"}

You will carefully assemble your team. You will curse loudly when they die.\n\nYou've probably heard this game be compared to Dark Souls at some point, but that doesn't really capture the whole picture. Darkest Dungeon is a game where you manage a GROUP of Dark Souls players--you'll organize them, prepare them, set the ball in motion with commands, but the burden of success lies at least partially with them. Out of your hands. As with real players, your characters will have a margin for error. You can minimalize it with planning, trinkets, and practice, but it will be there. Sometimes they will surprise you, somehow surviving certain death. And sometimes, everything will go wrong.\n\nIf you're still with me after that description, I can't recommend this game enough. I bought it in Early Access and my only regret is that I didn't find it earlier on Kickstarter so I could have backed it. Darkest Dungeon is packed with a character all its own, from the stress/affliction system, to the art, to the compelling narration of Wayne June as the Ancestor. The story is satisfying and as Lovecraftian as you would hope.\n\nIf you're on the fence about buying, it's worth the price of admission. Much more so if you catch it on sale. I bought the DLC and will update this review once I've finished it.\n\n-------------------------------\n\nDLC: Crimson Court\n\n-TL;DR I bought it, it was fun and neat, I'd buy it again and maybe a third time.\n\nGood: New content, new bosses, plenty of narrator voice acting, swathes of new awesome loot, tons of cool monsters, chance to have vampires working for you.\nBad: Intense difficulty spikes throughout the DLC, may be compeletely overpowering for new players, Crimson Curse is hard to deal with, RNG remains your God.\n\nWARNING - This DLC directly increases the difficulty of the base game. If that's not something you want, you might be frustrated with this DLC.\n\nI was hesitant to buy this DLC, I'll be honest. The core story was already polished and whole, and it felt like additions would be forced and possibly trite. Furthermore, there are few horror genres as tired and overdone as the Vampire. Still, I gave it a chance and, whew, what a ride. Where to start?\n\nTo begin with, the Crimson Court integrates itself into the game seamlessly and quickly. With the DLC active, you get a lead into this new side of the game as early as the first embarked mission (beyond the tutorial). Afterwards, you quickly tumble into a tempting new area, gated by a hidden challenge, that unleashes a new, and very immediate, peril upon the Hamlet. As is typical of Darkest Dungeon, when I say \"peril\" I mean that your heros can (and probably will) die of this new problem - The Crimson Curse.\n\nWhat's more, progressing through the DLC produces a taut, but pleasing, tension as the stakes grow higher and the need for the next goal accomplished becomes more immediate. For each of the three Expedition tiers (Apprentice, Veteran, and Champion), there is a story arc is told through normal expeditions, events in the Hamlet, narration, and in the Courtyard itself. After each tier, there is a break in which you can progress the normal game.\n\nPossibly the most fun part for me was the Trinket Sets. The art and flavor text on them are great, giving us hints at the origins of the various heroes of Darkest Dungeon, as well as providing interesting or powerful bonuses that set them apart from other trinkets. After collecting each and every set, I found it was definitely worth doing so, but I did not feel that the trinkets were required. In many cases, normal trinkets were far superior.\n\nI'll also say that the story of the Crimson Court was surprisingly satisfying. The extra cutscenes and narration made it feel like money well-spent. I will say, though, that it's easy to put yourself in a completely untenable position by opening the \"Pandora's Box\" too soon. You will need to learn how to deal with the Crimson Curse fast, and dedicate time and effort to resolving the story of the DLC or risk losing valuable heroes to the thirst.\n\n--------------------------------------\n\nDLC: Shieldbreaker\n\n-TL;DR She's awesome. Definetly worth 4 bucks on her own, and she comes with story, new enemies,  and new goodies.\n\nThe Good: No impact on difficulty, new expendable item that has a unique effect, Shieldbreaker is a badass with unique skills that make her fun and useful, breathes new life into Mark teams, additional blight support, unique counter for guard/PROT, her story is exciting to unravel. \nThe Bad: Compared to Crimson Court, there's not really much here. Three new enemies, an handful of trinkets, and a new hero. \n\nAfter the Crimson Court, I would have bought any DLC for this game. My first thought was that the Shieldbreaker DLC is mostly for diehards, but after giving it a chance, I was very excited at the relatively lengthy revelation of the Shieldbreaker's tale, told through normal gameplay. I can't say too much without major spoilers, but I will tell you that her special events do NOT happen in Crimson Court expeditions, so if you're trying to explore the Shieldbreaker's content, focus on the main areas of the game.", "author_steamid": "76561198000885351", "author_num_games_owned": 0, "author_num_reviews": 7, "author_playtime_forever": 34742, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 31456, "author_last_played": "2021-02-09T21:38:38+00:00"}

(Skip to the end if you want tl;dr)\n\nI noticed a lot of reviews citing the game as ‘too hard’ or ‘all about rng’ and I can tell you exactly why: those players were expecting a generic dungeon crawler where you can kerbstomp every boss with high level and super gear, and the managerial risk mitigation required in Darkest Dungeon (DD) is foreign and alien to them.\n\nAll the RPG nowadays features the player as this, omnipotent chosen one who is out to save the world single handly, DD subverts that 100%. Your team sports heros with mortal characteristics of strength and weakness, vices and fears that is nothing like the “chosen one out to save the world”. \n\nThat is fine, we have seen that in lores before but here is the kicker - You got to manage those flaws in DD! In fact, if you have worked in a corporate environment DD will be a piece of cake for you, since it is all about risk assessment and human resource (HR) management. \n\nWhat about the rng? \n\nLet's cover the risk assessment: to put it simply, you look at the LIKELIHOOD (rng) and CONSEQUENCE of a RISK to get a risk score, and you assign CONTROLS to reduce the two aforementioned factors. \n\nSay if my vestel is highly prone to stress in dark due to quirks, we have “RISK” of her getting psyched out and become incapable to heal. The “CONSEQUENCE” of that would be wiping and losing the juicy trinkets your squad has (catastrophic) and the chance of me having no torch may occur in long dungeons (possible). \n\nSo now, the typical gamers have two response : Vestel heal is weak, or negative quirks are too strong. They look at problems NOT solutions. \n\nTo a thinking gamer, a CONTROL will be applied. \nI can reduce the likelihood (rng)  by\n-Curing the quirk (if time permits)\n-Bring more torches \n-Have a man of arms to guard her\n-Have ranged damage that can wipe out stressors on round 1, IE dogs and highwayman\n\nTo reduce the consequence by\n-Strict retreat protocol- if the healer is not coping, escape combat \n-Have a crusader that can reduce stress\n-Have stress reduction camping skills\n-Have self heal on dps to reduce healer workload\n\nNow we have applied control, we have reduced the likelihood (rng) of healer getting psyched out from possible to unlikely level. And even if the healer does get psyched out we have controls to reduce the consequences from catastrophic to minor (if they retreat they go to town have a break no biggie). \n\nIt is understandable that risk management skill do not exist in the immature adults or children who have been fed with hero complex and unable to accept compromise, it is easier to just blame it on rng. \n\nWhile the game does have certain shortfalls like slow combat animation, overall it has pioneered a new type of dungeon crawler that's a fresh breeze compared to the old and outdated ‘grind to max level and save the world’ model. \n\nIn Conclusion:\nNot saying you have to like the game or agree to the review, but this is just not the typical game where god gear will win you 100% of the games, and if challenging games isn't your thing, you may need to reconsider purchasing it.

To summarize, Darkest Dungeon used to be significantly easier. Before the devs bumped up the difficulty I only had a handful of characters die, and I knew people who managed to get characters up to their highest rank without ever suffering a death.\n\nThe changes the devs made are not unfair. New mechanics were added to prevent players exploiting situations to fully heal every battle, and existing mechanics were changed to better fit the original vision—your characters are not heroes. No matter how powerful they become, being hurt is always something you want to avoid, overwhelming stress is not something you can ever just ignore, and manipulating the formation of both your party and the enemy party is crucial to winning each battle. \n\nBack before the changes, dungeon runs required significantly less forethought, and most runs could be completed relatively painlessly. Combat took only slightly more strategy than the typical random encounter in a Final Fantasy. Now each fight is a struggle for your life, and while this certainly makes the game more challenging, that kind of challenge is what was intended from the beginning. No doubt I'll get a half dozen angry messages berating me about something or other, but oh well.\n\nTL;DR: The game used to be much easier and full of ways to manipulate the system to breeze through even the hardest dungeons. Now people are upset that it was changed to punish people for trying to use cheap exploits. It's a very challenging game, and RNG can kick your butt, but you can ALWAYS avoid permanent death by cutting your losses and abandoning a mission. You are in control. Greed and overconfidence will be your downfall.\n\nAs for an actual review, I'll be brief: the overall aesthetic is wonderfully dark, and the whole game reflects the same sinister feeling of vain hope, of struggling towards an impossible goal and clawing your way forward. Success is short-lived and defeat is painful, but the journey is fantastic. Classes are all well balanced and monsters are varied and unique. Bosses will push you to your limits.

I picked this game up right after its release and unlike most people I like it now more than I did before, allow me to explain why this game is easily worth the $20.\n\n[b] First of all you won't like this game if you fit into the following two categories: [/b]\n[olist]\n[*] If you don't like turn based games or RPGs this game isn't for you, pretty strait forward. \n[*] If you don' like a challenge, and I mean a real challenge, if you put most of your games you play on easy and then prance through them congratulating yourself on a stellar job this game will bury your pride along with your party of heroes pretty fast. Its hard. \n[/olist]\n\n\n[b] Why do I like this game (the pros): [/b]\n[olist]\n[*] The narrator is great. fits the mood so well and makes everything come to life with the expansive vocabulary and deep timbre.\n[*] The artwork. Its superb, every review out there whether positive or negative will say it. It has the best art of any game I have seen a long time and like the narrator it helps the world come to life. The animation, though minimalist, is beautiful and powerful and really helps you feel the game. The sound is also great and helps build mood as it changes depending on how dark it is in the dungeon. At pitch blackness you hear the squeals, groans, shouts, or other sounds of the dungeon enemies off in the distance and during battle the music is louder and more ecstatic, making everything so much more tense. The aesthetics of this game alone make it work and suck you in, but that's not even the tip of the iceberg.\n[*] The gameplay (I said it, and I'll talk about why other people be hating later). I have always loved tactical turn based and this game is the cream of the crop. There are so many options when it comes to how to defeat your opponents. The enemy monsters are varied and that determines the tactical choices you make. It is brutally unforgiving and thus it takes actual planning to get a good hero lineup and execute with top efficiency; however no hero, ability, trinket or consumable is overpowered (some people say monsters are overpowered... but I'll get to that later). and there are so many ways and lineups to be used to clear dungeons. The tactical battles and overall strategy (the economy, stress heal, and leveling up) go hand in hand.\n\n\n[b] So why are other people not suggesting the game? [/b]\n\nYou can scroll through all the negative reviews but you only really need to read one to read all it basically: \"the patch ruined everything.\" But yet I don't buy into that train of thought and I will explain why:\nPre-corpse and hound patch the game way simply too easy, it was all over the forums too. \"This game is too easy its boring\" or \"after early game its a walk in the park\" were the complaints. Unlike currently there was an \"overpowered\" strat where they would take a crit loaded team with two powerful front line hitters and two back line supports into a dungeon, snuff the torch, and then go ham destroying the front line enemies thus exposing the back line enemies while the supports buffed them up to hit even harder. Battles could be over in two turns. Heroes that didn't work into that formula were never used, like the grave robber, plauge doctor, crusader and bounty hunter. Yes every hero was viable but nothing could clear dungeons like a crit loaded dark run (they also gave you the most gold because as the dungeons get darker the more gold you can find). \n\nThe Corpse and the hound added two unique mechanics that threw off the crit loaded dark runs. The first was corpses. Now when you kill and enemy his corpse remains, meaning that the weaker back line enemies can stay safely in the back line and keep throwing their stuff at you. This screwed over the crit-dark runs because now you had to hack through an enemy and then hack through his corpse to clear a path the back lines, making the battle go longer and thus their crit-dealing heroes took more damage. \n\nThe second mechanic added was PROT or protection to enemies, heroes had always been able to get PROT by the means of a trinket but it was never that big a deal (why would you get a PROT trinket when you could just get a trinket that would boost your crit chance for your crit-dark runs?) PROT basically mitigates damage taken, and now that enemies had it (some had very high amounts) it took the crit-dark run damage dealers a few turn to hack through what used to be an instant kill. Both these additions made battles last longer but also opened the space for new mechanics and strategies. now dark runs were much more risky because of the amount of damage you could rack up (in the dark monsters hit harder and more accurately). But an added mechanic was the DoTs (damage over time affects) like poison and bleed completely ignored PROT and if you killed an enemy with DoTs it didn't drop a corpse. The heroes that had DoT's were the heroes that were considered useless before the patch, they didn't become super overpowered they simply became an actual option that could work. \n\nBasically \"the patch\" made the game harder and that cause a lot of long time players that had forgotten difficulty and were (to use game analogy) \"fattened by decadence and luxury\" to rage because they were unable to adapt. People say things like \"This game used to be a gem and now I would recommend it to ANYONE!\" the unfortunate thing is that if the game had had these mechanics since the beginning everyone would have loved it due to the difficulty. And even if you are scared by all the \"the patch ruined everything\" reviews, know that the developers knew this would happen. In the corpse and hound patch notes they said at the end that \"we will be tweaking these mechanics because we won't know the exact results until after implementation\" and they have as of 8/18  nerfed enemy protection and made corpses weaker.  \n\n\n[b] Final thoughts [/b]\n\nI love this game, and the devs, Its only gotten better for me. I encourage anyone looking for a challenging game that will pull them into the lore and world to look past the negative reviews that all say the same thing. I wrote this review because I feel obligated to let everyone know why some people are mad. At the end of the day, despite the \"patch\" or PROT I thoroughly enjoy this game and recommend it to anyone remotely interested.\n\n[h1] 10/10 would go stalwart again.

It isn't a fair game, I don't even know if it's a 'fun' game but one is compelled to persist nonetheless.

It isn't that the game is hard, It's that you're dealing with a very hostile situation.

Any heroes that manage to return from a failed expedition to the dilapidated hamlet may carry back some treasures, but also diseases, stress, afflictions of both mind and body. And hopefully, while they have gained injury, as a player you will have gained knowledge to improve the next expedition in this fantastic tactical RPG.\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a punishing game, one that expects you to fail and learn from those failures. Heroes that rally to your desperate cause are a motley assortment of already damaged men and women, each implied to be seeking redemption or to atone from some dark past of their own. In the hamlet, you can spend money to upgrade these skills of these adventurers, upgrade their equipment, or send them to heal from the stresses of facing horrors with meditation, prayer, booze, or the brothel. While your hit points are automatically healed after each mission (if they come back -- deaths are permanent), the stresses endure, and maintaining the mental health of your roster is vital to long-term success. Thankfully, if heroes die -- and die they will -- more can always be recruited.\n\nWith your party healed, you send them in again, to both defeat the horrors that surround the hamlet, and to bring back the treasure and items needed to slowly upgrade the hamlet and give you slight advantages. Combat is turn-based, with both your party and enemies standing in rows of four. This positioning makes up a large part of the tactical decisions of the game. Characters have four abilities, each of which can only be used in certain positions and can hit certain rows. Additionally, many abilities are complimentary. The Occultist can mark enemies, for example, while the Arbalest gains a bonus to marked targets. Learning how to build parties that build on each other's skills -- and attempt to compensate for weaknesses -- is another large part of the tactics you learn. Your roster levels up as you learn these mechanics, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of the varied enemies you face. Eventually, you may even be brave enough to send your heroes to combat the evil in the manor itself.\n\nIn addition to the satisfying tactical combat, the game has a fantastic Lovecraftian aesthetic and theme in story, art, sound design, and animation. This is most evident in the Narrator, who comments on events as you play with a rich, dramatic delivery that might be almost camp, if it were not so skillfully done. If you heal a party member back from the brink of death, the might say, \"Death cannot be escaped -- but it can be postponed.\" Kill a large, powerful enemy, and he might tell you, \"Prodigious size alone does not dissuade the sharpened blade.\"\n\nDarkest Dungeon is punishing at every turn, forcing you to learn, to refine your tactics, to push to the edge of success or failure over and over. This can be frustrating at times -- complaints of \"grind\" in this game do have some merit -- but I found the gameplay loop consistently fun, even when it was punishing my failures. As the Narrator might say, \"Where there is no peril in the task, there can be no glory in its accomplishment.\"", "author_steamid": "76561197964867567", "author_num_games_owned": 281, "author_num_reviews": 48, "author_playtime_forever": 12911, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 12897, "author_last_played": "2020-08-23T18:01:27+00:00"}

I wasn't planning on playing over 100 hours of the game before making a review. I had originally planned to write it before, but my boyfriend encouraged me to wait until I beat the game or at least until I tried a serious run on the Darkest Dungeon. That is why it took me so long to write this.\nI got this game as a gift from boyfriend a couple of years ago, though even before that I had already seen him play the game quite a bit, and I really enjoyed it. There was just something about the dark nature of the game that just drew me in, so I was so happy when I got this game. And with all the hours I have put into the game, there are definitely some aspects I like, feel mixed about, and don't like, which is why I am going to make a review on it. Just keep in mind, I haven't finished the game completely. The most I have done is to do a serious attempt on the Darkest Dungeon once, so with that in mind, don't think there will be anything regarding the ending.\n\nSo, let's begin with the review!\n(Also, just for the record, this will probably be a long review, so bear with me)\n\nThings I like about the game:\n1. The different characters one can play as (and all the combinations for teams): So, one thing I really liked from the beginning was just how many different classes there were and how many different builds one could make. I feel like it gives you the ability to put your own style of gaming into the team you create. If you want a more damage dealing team, you can do it. If you wanna focus on evasion, you can do that too. And the amount of different styles is so fun. Whether it be damage, stress, glass cannon, evasion, prot, etc. It's just really fun to tinker around with them, and seeing what combination works best.\n2. The Narrator: Oh my god. I think most people who have played this game (Or well, at least the people I have known who also have this game) have commented on the narrator and his quotes. And honestly, that just makes the game so much more entertaining. Like, that voice and those lines just...have a way of sticking on you. To the point, my boyfriend, a friend of ours, and I just sometimes quote the narrator out of nowhere. So yes, I had to add that as something I like xD\n3. The music: So, I am usually the type of person who let's the music speak for the game in a lot of cases and Darkest Dungeon is no exception to that. Though there are many occasions I don't play with music in this game (for whatever reason), I do really like the music in the game. I think it speaks a lot about what is going on in the game, especially when it comes to all the stress and darkness that is occurring. \n4. The enemies/bosses (how diverse they can be): Now, while I was thinking of putting this in the mixed section of this review (because some enemies can just be absolutely tedious to deal with), I just love how original the designs are. Like, especially when one goes into the harder dungeons, I like how disturbing the enemies look and it's just so....amazing. The bosses are also pretty cool in regards to their looks (though some of them can be extremely annoying to face, which comes from me who swore to defeat all bosses before going into the Darkest Dungeon). \n5. How the dungeons map change every time you go in: I don't think I need to explain this much further. I just feel it adds a sense of difference each time you go into a dungeon. \n6. The mods: To be honest, this is the first game I have ever played while using mods, and oh my god. Do they add to the experience. So, when I first saw my boyfriend play Darkest Dungeon for me, I didn't know he was using mods (since a lot of the character just blend in so well with the entire game). This got me into using some of those mods, as well. And I will tell you, it makes such a difference. The mods that fit in so well with the game that you don't even realize they are mods and just the different types of characters that are added with those mods is just so fun and amazing.\n\nNow, that I've mentioned some of the things I like, time to bring up things I am more mixed about. \n1. The difficulty: Now, I wasn't really certain on where to put this, as it is something that adds a lot of charm to the game and a lot of satisfaction when one succeeds. However, there are just some things that I find just...so difficult that it makes me go crazy. Now I played this game on Radiant, and you would think, it would be a walk in park. It isn't and I knew that. But just seeing some of the things my boyfriend has experienced in harder difficulties, and what I experienced in the Darkest Dungeon (and that's excluding what I have faced in regular dungeons) and it's like....How's one supposed to beat that? So yeah, I needed to put this in mixed feelings. \n2. How certain items you interact with can do barely any good: So, for people who have played this, it's hard not to mention the different items you can interact with on your way through a dungeon. And while I am not against putting both good and bad items in the game, I will say that some items...it's like there isn't even a point to interact with them cause all they do is bad. Like, with other items, there are percentages and it's up to you if you want to take the risk or not of interacting with them, but then there are just some that immediately you should steer clear from. And it's...a very mixed feeling I have on that. \n3. The length of some dungeons: You know, I won't go into too much detail on this. All I will say, is that (1) I am just happy that I can choose what type of dungeon I can go through (from short to long) and (2) I think I have only done a long run in a dungeon once, because I felt it was so tedious to do the long ones. Like I am okay with camping once, camping more than that....ehhh. Yeah.\n4. The inventory size: Oh boy, I am surprised this didn't end up on the dislike side of this review. But you know, it's very mixed. On one side, I can kind of understand why the inventory is so small (especially on a game where supplies should feel a bit more limited), it can get kind of annoying at times. Like sometimes I just wish that as you progressed, you could get more inventory size. But, overall, it's nothing too bad that it ruins my experience.\n\nAnd those are the things I feel mixed about. When it comes to things I dislike about the game, I couldn't really think of any except well...the collector! Because he just annoys me, especially when he pops out of nowhere to ruin my run) and well, sometimes the whole equipping trinkets and upgrading gear can get quite tedious, but that's just more because I forget to do it (and my bf and our friend wonder how I am able to progress without doing that).\n\nOverall, I really love this game. Despite it's downfalls and things I feel mixed about, I really love this game and would even go so far as to say it is one of my favorite games right now. There's just soo much to do and so many hours you can put into this game. It's so fun! I would recommend it to anybody who likes these dark types of games with turn-based strategy. And well, that's all I have to say for this review.\n\nPS: It took me a bit over an hour to write this, so there are probably some things I forgot, but overall this review gives my point of view on the game as well as I possibly could.\n", "author_steamid": "76561198848601006", "author_num_games_owned": 235, "author_num_reviews": 52, "author_playtime_forever": 6807, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 39, "author_playtime_at_review": 6176, "author_last_played": "2026-01-25T14:34:39+00:00"}

This is a great game for people interested in tense turn-based combat as well as dungeon crawling and treasure collecting. I found the party building to be my favorite part (I would spend hours thinking how different groups of heroes would play together and more work out well than you'd think).

Quite possibly.\n\nDarkest Dungeon is a game I only recently discovered, and I'm very glad I did.\nAn incredibly punishing game that should please masochists the world over - Darkest Dungeon combines a variety of gameplay elements spanning several genres, and heavy influence from Lovecraftian mythos with dark gothic themes.\nPlaying as somewhat of an RPG/DnD/adventure/roguelike hybrid, the game focuses upon building a party and completing quests through side-scrolling exploration riddled with turn-based strategy for combat. This may sound fairly stock-standard, but the added element of \"stress\" adds a layer of depth unlike any I've seen in a game.\n\nEach character has a set amount of HP. Simple? Yes.\nEach character has a set level of stress at any given point in time. Simple? Not quite.\n\nActions while questing, fighting, resting and returning to town in-between quests will all have an impact on a character's stress; this is what turns an otherwise fairly simple RPG into a challenging, punishing experience of a game. Once stress level on a character hits 100, they turn insane: acting irrational, spreading stress among party members, attacking of their own accord in battles. This is exactly what you want to avoid. \n\nI could go on about Darkest Dungeon for several pages, but that would simply be detracting from the amount of time you could be spending actually playing it.

See Conclusion[/h1]\n\n[h1]INTRODUCTION:[/h1]\nDarkest Dungeon is a [b]grimdark[/b] dungeon crawling, side scrolling, mixed turn-based combat and real time adventure, rogue-like game developed and self-published by Red Hook Studios.\n\nThe game boasts several unique features, the most prominent of which is the Stress system which may cause your heroes to either panic or rally depending on the situation. If a hero panics, said hero may become 'afflicted' or become 'virtuous,' becoming either a liability or a benefit to your current expedition.\n\nThis game was made possible through crowd funding via Kickstarter, as well as Early Access.\n\n[h1]PLOT (No Spoilers):[/h1]\nThe player takes on the role of an unnamed 'Heir' of a powerful and wealthy family. After being called back to his ancestral home by an enigmatic figure known as 'The Ancestor' who awoken a sleeping evil within the depth of the family Manor, the Heir must now use what remains of the family fortune to gather a rag tag group of adventurers to explore, cleanse, reclaim, and rebuild his family's estate from the evil that now inhabits it.\n\n[i]“Women and men... soldiers and outlaws... fools and corpses. All will find their way to us now that the road is clear.” - The Ancestor[/i]\n\n[h1]PROS:[/h1]\n+ [b]AMAZING[/b] grimdark 2D artstyle\n+ Very good narration and voice acting\n+ Very good sound design and music that matches with the game's theme\n+ Numerous and versatile classes – there is a certain joy in experimenting with different classes, parties and skill compositions\n+ Very good and unique gameplay mechanics such as:\n[list]\n[*] Torch and light levels that directly affects gameplay\n[*] Stress levels (Heroes can panic and become less effective if stress goes to high)\n[*] Quirk System (Adds certain positive or negative effects to your heroes)\n[/list]\n+ Skill customization for the heroes – this makes them relevant even with different party compositions and tactical situations\n+ Harsh but manageable difficulty levels – mandatory autosave and no reloads with permanent hero deaths\n+ Good overall presentation\n+ Good replayability\n+ Lengthy game time\n+ Interesting back story and lore\n\n[h1]CONS:[/h1]\n- Limited number of dungeons – to be fair, the dungeons are procedurally generated.\n- Sudden and unexpected difficulty spikes – specially when transitioning from Veteran to Champion\n- Limited visual customization for both town and heroes – [url=http://www.nexusmods.com/darkestdungeon/mods/searchresults/?src_cat=12]mods[/url] are available if you want to change hero skins\n- Resources (other than gold) becomes irrelevant late game, specially once the town is fully upgraded\n- Limited number of trinkets (equipment and accessories)\n- Occational graphic glitch\n- One or two crashes here and there\n\n[h1]NEUTRAL:[/h1]\n+/- The back story and lore is nice, but the game's story itself boils down to “kill the boss” – you can skip all other bosses and the back story with it.\n\n[h1]CONCLUSION:[/h1]\n[b]GREAT GAME[/b] for any dungeon crawler and turn-based tactics fan. Featuring a good back story backed up with amazing artstyle, Darkest Dungeon brings to the player the tactical challenge of XCOM, the grimdarkness of Dark Souls, and the joy of exploration of a Dungeons & Dragons campaign, all in one package.\n\n[h1]WORTH IT?[/h1]\nI can easily [b]RECOMMEND Darkest Dungeon at its full price[/b] of $24.99 USD (or your regional equivalent). With good replayability from the unique classes and the relatively unpredictable combat results, the game can last you for at least 20 hours or more.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------- \n[h1]Like my Reviews?

So my play time is more than steam shows. Yet i never had a will to finish as this games gradually gets harder and harder as you progress. Your heroes' being getting leveled up gives you false impression about you are getting stronger but as heroes levels up they can no longer be send to low level dungeons. Dungeons they are compatible are way harder than low level ones. You upgrade their armor and their weapon and their skills AND equip them with better trinkets and quirks JUST to send to the way deadlier dungeons where they can get critted %70 hp's they have. This feeling gives you all hours you spent to improve your heroes are just to become more miserable in high level dungeons.\n\nAlso as game progress - as dungeons gets deadlier - you have to pay attention to everything you do. You have to send specific heroes to specific dungeons and equip them with specific skills and quirks, because otherwise you have no chance against foes you encounter. The very first encounter you face in dungeon hits you so hard that makes you realise that expedition you think you'll be fine won't end in your favor. I can't calculate everything while playing. This obligation overwhelms me.\n\nBelieve it or not you make some emotional link with some of your heroes because you invest some time and gear and memories with them. They do good performances in earlier dungeons. So that makes you confident that one level higher dungeon won't be too bad. You think they get strong enough to brace upcoming difficulties. That is until you face your first encounter in champion level dungeon and then they die.\n\nIf steam asks me if i recommend this game to others? No i dont.\n\nBUT if i was asked if this game was good, i certainly say this is a GOOD GAME because it does what it was programmed to do. This game is about making choices in bad situations.

DD has always been a somewhat difficult game that can be really cruel with RNG, especially as you frist start out.  Many people say that there is no \"fail state\", but you feel like a failure when you lose about 10-20 hours of progress per character you lose.  There have been ways to be careful, risky, and successful while mitigating the risk of horrible RNG; however, the developers have taken it upon themselves to not only patch out the clever ways you can make your characters not die, but also introduce new facets that screw you over more.\n\nThe reason I don't recommend this game is because I feel like the developers are heavy-handed with their patch fixes based on how players are deciding to play their game, rather than actually fixing the bugs and features that aren't working properly.  Several trinkets simply don't work, several skills don't work as intended (looking at you, Man at Arms with Guard, thanks for getting my Arbalest one shot), several of the buffs and debuffs don't work as intended, and now the enemies and dungeons are for the most part broken.  Since the patch, I've had to retreat from all 5 dungeons because of the new enemies, the limitations on items you can bring (for instance, there were 2 wall curios in the first 3 hallways in the Cove, and since I was on a scouting mission I ran out of shovels and couldn't complete the dungeon without clawing through the other 5 wall curious I saw).\n\nIn short, the game has always been hard.  The game has always been out to get you, and set you back on time you've spent playing it (by getting your hard-earned heroes killed with crits).  Just like the intro says, DD is about making the best out of difficult situations.  The game in its current state, and with the way the developers have been taking it, is pure masochism.   I'm not sure if the developers playtest their game, because if I were them I sure as hell wouldn't want to.\n\nIf you've made it through this wall of text to this far, please excuse me if I seem like I'm bitching.  I actually like rogue-likes, and I'm familiar with the concept of being set back in time and losing things permanently.  Nobody likes being treated unfairly, and it feels like the game is a chore.  If the idea was to make it stressful, it's just annoying.  On the plus side, the developers ARE active and DO create new content frequently, but on the negative side a lot of the ideas they take from the community are pretty stupid.\n\nAll in all, if you're thinking of purchasing this game, it might be a good idea to wait until it's finished.\n\nEdit for clarity:\n\nAfter seeing the positive reviews that mostly knock players for not understanding the mechanics, I figured I'd approach those mechanics from a different angle than the positive reviews, since I do understand the mechanics.\n\nThe trinkets:\nI feel like they simply aren't balanced.  Most of the \"Ancestral\" (legendary trinkets) hurt more than they help.  For instance, one gives 5% increased crit to melee, but adds 5% stress damage to your characters.  That character will be targeted by stress attacks by the AI if he has the lowest stress resist and is in a position to be targeted, and you will be dished out more stress damage by the two to three enemies that deal stress damage than you will ever be able to recoup with your one turn and 5% increased crit.  On the plus side, at least this trinket works as intended.\n\nThe increased prices:\nMost people aren't complaining about the increased prices because it makes the game \"harder\", it just makes the grind longer and makes it more of a pain in the ass.  Also, the sting of defeat hits a lot harder and your start is a lot rougher.  Has this specific issue bugged me?  No, not really.\n\nCurios:\nHonestly, they're not that big of a deal except for the item limitation imposed now.  When you have a bank, you want to overprepare - now you can't.  You can always just ignore curios and get rid of quirks that force you to interact with curios.\n\nHealing:\nThe devs don't want you to faceroll everything with damage stacking, but they also don't want you to be able to heal your heroes against lone targets.  So they add stun resistance to monsters for multiple stuns, then they add stress damage, then they add increased stress damage for stalling, then they add monster reinforcements.  Has this ever affected me personally?  No, because for the most part I manage my heals pretty well and bring balanced parties that are tailored to specific dungeons.  Do I find it stupid that the developers are punishing people who ALREADY take a tedious and careful approach, gut it, and make the game even MORE tedious and punishing?  Yeah, but for for the most part this facet also hasn't really affected me.\n\nFacerolling:\nDo you have Legendary heroes with max equipment and skills?  Did they ever completely faceroll everything?  Or do you still get your Occultist eldritch pulled into a treebrance smackdown from a giant?  Yeah, same here.  The game has never been \"too easy\" or \"too hard\", but as your heroes leveled and upgraded your start to reduce the variance which leads to a catastrophic collapse of your party.  One bad move, one bad stress hit crit, one bad bleed stack, one bad smackdown crit could all lead to damage you cannot recoup in A SINGLE BATTLE.  The recent patches have made even non-room battles more deadly.\n\nClass choices:\nLet's face it, some classes are just underpowered.  I use the Grave Robber just because she's one of my favorites, and she's a great support unit.  Depending on where you are, you can remove blight and bleed, make her a dodge tank, or turn her into a crit monster.  The Jester and the Man at Arms are both great units to use in conjunction with her, but her low health has always made her vulnerable.  Guarantee she's going to hit death's door at least once, maybe three or four times if you're taking her to a boss battle.  I use her not always because she's the optimal choice, but I like the concept.  With the new patch, I pretty much only want to use Bounty Hunter for my scouter.  The Houndmaster is pretty cool, but again he's pretty underpowered as well.  Weak 1-2 damage AOE hits with bleed only serve well against maybe one fight, and that's the formless flesh.  In other words, there's cases where heroes have a skill that is useful in only ONE portion of the game - also looking at you, Man at Arms skill Guard - which doesn't always work by the way, especially against the Prophet.  In a game where the developers nerf heroes that are being used to \"faceroll\" things and do large amounts of damage, the other heroes which are underpowered and suboptimal in pretty much every dungeon are left untouched.  If anything, it shows a lack of focus and forward thinking on the developers part - flaws that will be fatal to you as the player in a dungeon, but compeltely acceptable for the game's creators...\n\nFor the most part, I tend to leave the game specific gripes out because people thinking about buying the game... haven't played it.  But for those of you complainig about the negative reviews and saying \"those who reveiew negatively just need to git gud and stop QQing\", there are legimate reasons why people don't like DD.  I've loved this game since the beginning, but l don't like the direction the developers are taking it.\n\nIf you enjoy the game as it is, please direct your butthurt elsewhere.

But to sum it up I just can't recommend the game. \n\nThere are some bright spots. First and foremost the atmosphere is great. The narration is just so on point. And it really gets you going. Then the game starts and its just draws you right in. The game goes great. The rougelike keeps its interesting with permadeath and the random stat changes can keep the characters interesting. The art is fantastic. The areas seem interesting and deep. \n\nThen the turn, evetually though the game switches. It really stops being fun it becomes a grind with a capital G. Now I actaully enjoy the grind mostly. Played RPGs all my life and there can be something nice about grinding. However, this game swtiches so hard from the fun of exploring and a very real adventuring sense to this MASSIVE grind that it is jarring and incredibly unfun. The game turns into work there is no progression you feel from anything for a long, long, LONG time. \n\nDue to the atrociousness of the grind the other flaws really start to show. The RNG becomes a bit unbearable. RNG can be really fun and leave a sense of the unexpected in the air. However, when its combined with the Mt. Everest of a grind it becomes this ulgy mechanic that can just ruin any gameplay. For instance, you are forced to run the same area for the millionth time just to grind out some charcters when RNG strikes and you lose someone important. This sucks so much, not that permadeath is bad or that RNG + permadeath can't offer really fun games, but because that it wasn't due to ANYTHING you decided. YOU didn't take a risk, YOU didn't overextend, YOU didn't do anything. The game forced you into a boring task and then punished you for it anyways. Then you realize the maps are the same, the monsters are the same, everything is the same. The rougelike randomness and vareity of monsters in each area that started off very cool has become so very boring. Simply becuase you spend a lifetime in each area trying to grind things out. And switching back and forth does little to break this up due to the sheer number of times you have played a map there. \n\nIt is sad it is an amazing game off the bat. You will love it right away, then it will slowly make you hate it, dread turing it on. It becomes a job you can't stand.

Most RPGs rely on a gameplay loop where the player alternates between gameplay and narrative. Darkest Dungeon does an impressive job of fusing gameplay and narrative so that the player gets both at once. \n\nAnd it's a good thing they managed to create gameplay that feels narratively meaningful because the player is going to have to do a LOT of gameplay and it is going to feel very, very familiar after a while. For the amount of time this game takes to beat you are going to face the same enemies, with the same or very similar group of adventurers, again and again. \n\nYou are going to hear the same few voice lines every time you lose a hero that took a dozen hours of attention and worry to create, an event you know will make the game take another dozen hours or more to complete. If those voice lines were anything other than perfect then they would feel insulting, like the creators had padding their game with repeating content to extend the game's runtime. It's a good thing that in Darkest Dungeon the voice lines always feel perfect, being read by professional H.P. Lovecraft narrator Wayne June, and that the stress the game inflicts on the player likewise feels narratively justified. \n\nPlaying Darkest Dungeon feels less like conventional recreation and more like the satisfaction that comes from working on a long interesting project. It feels like researching something obscure, off-kilter, frustratingly elusive, and that is what is so horribly wonderful about the game.", "author_steamid": "76561198036054515", "author_num_games_owned": 0, "author_num_reviews": 79, "author_playtime_forever": 7877, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 5518, "author_last_played": "2025-10-10T02:26:41+00:00"}

At the very beginning, as soon as you boot up the game, it tells you that Darkest Dungeon is all about making the best of a bad situation, and I'm sure anyone who's put any amount of time into the game, can confirm that this is definitely the case.\n\nEffectively, the game plays as thus; A week passes every mission, there are multiple 'Dungeons' you can go to, each with their own trials and tribulations, enemy types and bosses, you take a party of four that will suit that dungeon and complete the given task. After that task is completed (or failed) party members will level up and you'll earn gold and trinkets, which you use to upgrade your Hamlet (Effectively your base of operations) in order to become stronger to make dungeoning easier and get access to harder quests.\n\nThere are a multitude of heroes/classes to choose from, each of them bringing their own unique abilities and playstyle to the game. You can also rename all of your heroes to anything you want, making the game ideal for those who want to put their friends in the game (This is what I do for all games that I can, such as XCOM or Phoenix Point or Disgaea) or also ideal for Twitch Streamers as you can make your chat feel more involved by naming them after people in there.\n\nThe gameplay loop is very satisfying and I don't ever get bored playing this game, although what I will say is, things -will- go wrong. You will lose that max level hero to something out of your control, yes you can debate that the game is mostly RNG, but think of the game more like D&D as opposed to other turn based RPG's, it's the dice that does decide at the end of the day. However you do have a multitude of ways of mitigating damage and making sure you're getting the most out of your heroes, if you plan ahead well, know when to take a loss as well (tactically) you'll be fine.\n\nThe game is long, there's no doubt about that, you're talking anywhere between 30-50 hours for one proper run at the game, beating the final boss and all.\n\nAnother great aspect about the game is the Hamlet, randomly you'll get Town Events, these can be positive or negative. Things such as... The Tavern is free for the week, or a free weapon upgrade (This can be particularly helpful in the mid-game when money is an issue.) Or negative ones such as a big bad boss is at your doorstep all of a sudden, with no preparation and you -need- to deal with him. It makes the game feel alive, like not everything is always 100% under your control, and this, for me, is what makes the game so exhilarating. \n\nIn truth, I don't really have anything bad to say about the game, I guess I've been done over by RNG a few times but upon reflection, I guess I could've prepared better, but sometimes I did just get crit 3 times in a row and had a hero die, but I also don't see how blaming RNG for losing someone is a bad thing, especially when that's the nature of the game; you expect this going into it. But that's the reality of the game, I'd say it's a feature and not a flaw, you can do all the preparation in the world and be set up perfectly, but as the narrator so aptly puts it, as you think you're doing well. \"How quickly the tide turns.\"\n\nTo me, this is one of the best games ever made, it offers extensive replay-ability and despite its unforgiving nature, it's extremely rewarding, I promise when you pull off something magnificent, or one of your heroes becomes Virtuous, or you beat a boss that was skelping you endlessly, you'll be jumping out of your seat in joy.\n\n10/10.\n", "author_steamid": "76561198018866990", "author_num_games_owned": 801, "author_num_reviews": 93, "author_playtime_forever": 12963, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 12889, "author_last_played": "2025-02-03T16:12:18+00:00"}

From the start it looked very fun, interesting and most importantly...difficult. It wasn't a game like so many where it's tailored to just get you from start to end. Where you mess up any number of times and just get more chances. With Darkest Dungeon there is room for error, but it's a very small room; and most the time you have to take a loss of some sort.\n\nAnyways into the real details.\nPROS:\n- Game looks, feels and sounds amazing\n- Combat system is fun, alas very random.\n- Upgrade system is very well done, with 4 different types of upgrade mats\n- Stress system is great, you get broken down mentally and physically, which is what seemed so interesting\n- Random dungeon layouts proves for a fun new adventure every time you embark\n- The game is VERY fun!\n\nCONS: \n- As it's been said so many times before in other reviews, good and bad; the RNG is not only too random, it's BEYOND frustrating. I fell this is by far the biggest issue with the game at current development. I'm not sure if it's a tooltip issue, or programming issue, or what the underlying cause is; but the RNG is far too random. I've literally (meaning literally not OMG \"literally\") had a 85% hit chance skill miss 9 times in a row. Now with 15% miss chance, sure it's not impossible, but this happens often in sperts of \"bad RNG\". It wasn't just a single time. When you have \"low light\" from your torch you're supposed to have a higher crit % according to the tooltip, but I don't think I've ever crit while doing a \"no light\" run. All in all, if you get angry at games on any level whatsoever, this game will definitely piss you off from time to time...often enough.\n\n- The Sanitarium is a joke, not only is it ridiculously expensive, with having to reduce stress after almost every dungeon, you never have time to put your characters in there. ESPECIALLY since you get a new affliction (debuff) almost every single run as well. So what is really the point of it? The Sanitarium needs to reduce stress as well, not as much as the Abbey or Tavern (otherwise they would become worthless in place of the Sanitarium), but by a 50% rate or something.\n\n- The in-dungeon character dialogue. They like to talk a lot, and when they do it stops whatever you are doing. It becomes increasingly annoying when they say the same things over and over as well. So you're not just being stopped to hear something interesting, you're being stopped to read the same thing over and over. It becomes unbareable when they get full stress and break, because in the battle they say something non stop and you spend 50% of the time waiting for them to shutup.\n\n- There is no structured combat rotation, it seems characters can go whenever they want. It's never \"your turn\" and then \"enemy turn\". Also, sometimes in particular with \"surprise\" attacks the enemy can go multiple times in a row, before you can. So at that point you're so far behind in the dungeon with almost maxed stress and no HP it's a miracle of you get out with all 4 people alive, or finish it at all.\n\nIt's early access, so we'll see where they take the game, but right now it's still worth playing if you can deal with moments of being annoyed and hating your characters sometimes. Even with all the at length CONS, I still highly recommend the game.", "author_steamid": "76561197988446852", "author_num_games_owned": 0, "author_num_reviews": 10, "author_playtime_forever": 11313, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 1568, "author_last_played": "2019-03-29T22:24:06+00:00"}

Darkest Dungeon... I kept myself from writing a review until I was able to finish the whole game. And now that I finally did it, im ready for this. The question is: are you?\n\nThere's a lot to discuss about this piece. You maybe ask yourself : why so much negative reviews about with 100+ hours of gameplay? There is a clear answer (if you haven't read the other reviews, of course) but I'll explain it later. This is gonna be long, I can feel it. Take a cup of coffee and take your time to digest all the information im gonna give you:\n\n>Atmosphere\nSurely the most interesting point of the game. The art style, as you can clearly see is amazing, fabulous. I could even marry it. The characters, environments and enemies are pieces of art incredibly well done. Music rocks too. Narrator is so cool. \n\n>Before going into the combats themselves, I'm concerned I should explain what's everything about in a short way: old rich man living in a town, wow such hookers and alcohol everything is amazing but oh wait my mansion has some kind of dark sorcery stuff better waste all my money in expeditions to find what's all this about. Oh monsters I could never expect this etc etc etc so now the man is broken and needs the help of weirdos that come to the town with the promise of money (more or less like mercenaries, as I see it). Got it? Yep that explanation sucks. But the lore is cool and is better to discover while playing.\n\n>In Darkest Dungeon City Simulator 2420 you have some buildings that must be upgraded in order to be useful. It will take a long to have the Town at its fullest but you know, take it easy. Everytime you do a mission with a party a week passes in the game, and between weeks you can prepare the next expeditions, upgrade buildings, check the lore or cry for the hero \"Trump420blazeit\" that you lost in the last mission.\n\n>RNG: means Random Number Generator, and can be your best friend or worse than Hitler forcing you to eat broccoli. Basically im talking about luck. Darkest Dungeon depends a lot on RNG, is one of the points that people seems to complain about more. I agree with them, because at a certain point of the game your skill does not matter as far as It should. Pray at your god, will be more effective. \n\n>Combats are very well executed and give you the feeling of the battle, but I would like to point the STRESS. It's gonna be your worst nightmare. Your dear ''heroes'' will suffer it a lot when fighting, and when the number reachs 100, you're f****d because it triggers an event. This implies your hero getting totally mad or emerging victorious and becoming the hero of the heroes. Much luck involved again. However, watching your hero becoming the boss of the world among the chaos of the battlefield is amazing. But if he gets mad, he will refuse to be healed or swap position with others, so get ready for the worse. Maybe it sounds obvious, but if a hero dies we won't be able to fight more. Can't bring him to a Pokémon Center, you know. Anyway if you're lucky there's some events in town that could... Help you. \n\n> I Tend to call them heroes but they aren't. This is important. They can die. Anytime. Even from a crit of the weakest enemy of the game. But more will come, and after losing your most loved characters a few times you will understand what's all this about. This is about decisions. Every one counts, and can make you achieve a precious victory or lose your entire party when the boss is at 5 hp. Consider when to play safe or take risks, because Darkest Dungeon is excellent at one thing: making you regret your mistakes. (Oh, I still miss Carlos IV).\n\n>Bosses: of course a game of this class must have bosses! Every boss appears 3 times, so you have to beat it in aprentice, veteran and champion. Champion is the real shit and I have to take several pills in order to talk about it without crying, full detail later. (This review is starting to lose the point but I'm actually enjoying it). As I was saying, bosses are extremely difficult without preparation and knowledge about them, so It's on you if checking guides or not. I won't blame you. Nobody will because we all did it after losing an entire party vs the Brigade Pounder ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) But anyway they are very rewarding, in loot and in the feeling of victory.\n\n>Curios: basically furniture and stuff that can be interacted with objects, and can give lots of cash or bleed/blight/diseases/etc If you risk touching them without protection. I suggest checking the wiki in order to not waste many resources, as they are very limited.\n\n>As i pointed a moment ago, the quests of Champion difficulty are crearly unbalanced. Enemies have sick amounts of dodge and critical %, and minibosses appear very often in the rooms you explore. In these missions is where RNG shines a lot, and if you didn't take interest in understanding how curios and positioning works you'll fail miserably. Or not. Who knows?\n\nNOW LET'S FACE THE REAL SHIT\n\n[b]YOU THOUGHT PEOPLE ONLY COMPLAIN ABOUT RNG? OOH POOR FOOL [/b]\n\nOnly if you're ready I'll proceed to explain what made me hate the game as much as I love it.\n\n>The fact is... Well... The last scenario is the Darkest Dungeon (no spoilers, chill) and consists of 3 missions + the final boss itself. To complete this missions you'll need to farm a lot. But a lot. I mean send parties and parties of low level just to get loot, die and be replaced to use this money to enforce the best members of the roaster. Because you'll spend an indecent quantity of money in replacing quirks, curing diseases, upgrading armors and weapons and curing stress. Then you'll have an entire party at It's maximum and all of them will die in the mission of the last scenario :D Because this is it huahauah I'm not even mad but It happened to me and FeelsBadMan it hurted more than my father's belt.\n\n> I completed the game (including all the bosses) in 280 weeks aprox, but I took my time. The most sick players do it in like 22 weeks but trust me is a suicide. Just take your time and enjoy the game. There's no rush and It's hard to get used of it.\n\n>The developers seem to take care of their game, because are nowadays upgrading free content, events, new quirks and even enemies. The patch had some major bugs and were fixed in less than an hour so hey! I appreciate that. On the other hand, a DLC is coming soon and still can't tell much about it. For now I only know I'll go back to Stardew Valley in a journey to forget everything I saw in Darkest Dungeon. Too much feels, too much emotions.\n\n>For now, this is It. I don't know if someone will even reach this point of the review but if you did thanks for reading! Hope it helped you. I completely recommend the game if you're looking for a challenge in your Steam library. Even after all the bad moments Darkest Dungeon gave to me, I'm still gonna hit the ''Yes'' button of recommendation.\n\n[i]\"Sucess so clearly in view...

The key point is that the development team behind the game has tuned the game to target a unique player experience that makes Darkest Dungeon unique and rewarding to play. \n\nDarkest Dungeon isn't just another RPG, and I don't blame anyone for approaching it like one. There are plenty of on-screen cues and tips that guide the player, but for players who have played since the beginnings of Early Access, it's easy to overlook them and not start from square one. Players who are completely new to Darkest Dungeon are likely to heed these in-game suggestions and warnings at face value, and may have a better experience as a result. \n\nI do not think the game is perfect, but it's pretty great and worth your time and money to experience.\n\n\nThere are a lot of negative reviews gaining traction with a severe misunderstanding of the way the game is currently intended to be played, and I want to shed some light on why this game is actually AMAZING, and has CHANGED over time to become BETTER. There aren't going to be ANY story spoilers here, just basic mechanics--more or less just the hamlet's features and how they interact with the core gameplay.\n\nIt is a difficult game, and it is an RPG. When the going gets tough in a traditional RPG, there's usually a couple ways to deal with that: grinding monsters for money, gear, and experience, completing sidequests, and so on.\n\nIn Darkest Dungeon, you have a variety of resources at your disposal. \n\nYou have Heirlooms (used to upgrade your Hamlet facilities), you have Gold (required to use your Hamlet facilities and stock up on supplies before an expedition), you have trinkets(a way of customizing your heroes and buffing their abilities), and you have the Heroes themselves--a renewable resource. Each of your heroes has their own set of resources and attributes: Resolve Level, Sanity, Quirks, Disease, Equipment, and Spells. \n\nHere's the part where people go wrong: they try to min-max, they try to save their heroes, they'll make sure their heroes have all of their gear and spells upgraded before sending them out. This game restricts your resources far too hard for that, and makes your gains from doing so miniscule--you do make a profit, but its tiny and takes a long time. The profit margin of gold on maintaining perfectly geared heroes and sending them on optimal missions is almost non-existent, and players see this as being the 'grindfest' as they slowly approach the endgame, often trying to circumvent this game's difficult mechanics (popular Steam guides are guilty of this!) by 'grinding it out,' using strategies such as suicide-gold runs (which are a time sink in and of themselves, adding to the grind illusion)...\n\nThose narrow margins of profit? The seemingly unending grind? Its a losing strategy that was made worse by the developers to discourage that style of play, and those players aren't adjusting their gameplay. \n\nProgression through this game's intense difficulty isn't made by grinding out the perfect heroes, its by taking what you have and going for it. You're going to fail. You're going to lose heroes. You're going to hit brickwalls. But you're going to learn the absolute limits of every hero, the absolute limits of your style of play, and you'll push those limits. Your profit margins will double or triple as you start to play every situation perfectly, taking advantage of good luck and avoiding the bad luck from having an opportunity to take you down.\n\nBrute-forcing a grind through the game is technically possible. But you shouldn't do it. \nThis game wants you to face its depths head-on, and as soon as you do, it drags you further down and constricts you even more.\n\nWhen you finally get it though--when you finally make your way through the most difficult sequences of the game--there is very little more rewarding. It doesn't happen because you grind. It doesn't happen because you followed a strategy--it happens because you got dealt a hand of cards and made the absolute best of it.", "author_steamid": "76561197995771543", "author_num_games_owned": 176, "author_num_reviews": 6, "author_playtime_forever": 4970, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 4475, "author_last_played": "2025-04-25T06:22:42+00:00"}

It's a harsh, unforgiving game that will not let you return to earlier saves or give you a leg up (except for the in-game items). It's a mix of decision-making, battle tactics and party composition, with a dash of RNG.\n\nNow, there's a lot of people that complain about the RNG being unforgiving, cruel and often ruining dungeon runs. To that a knowledgeable person will say \"that's the point\". Sometime's Lady Luck will be on your side, and you'll be scoring crit after crit, while dodging the enemy's attacks. Other times, your party will be crushed in the first few encounters. One of the skills that DD require is, as earlier mentioned, decision making. RNG reinforces that. Do you think you can handle another corridor before you make camp? Do you think the next room will have the trinket you're looking for, or are you gonna stumble upon a ghoul and lose half of your team? We will all make bad decisions in the beginning, but it's the point - we learn. We learn to take more items than we [i] really [/i] need, we pay more attention to the characteristics of every dungeon (for example, that bleed builds are great for some and subpar for others). Or, as I also have done, we don't learn and bull rush ahead, hoping that luck will really let you find that last trinket.\n\nYou could say that's the point and dynamic of the game. You start out young, bold and brash, and learn, often painfully, how to run this horrid hamlet. And if you're any good, soon you'll notice that you can, at least partially, go against the RNG and win. Trinkets, well-built characters, your own experience and knowledge. And suddenly you're done. You've beat the game, maybe at Radiant, maybe not, but still you beat it. And it doesn't seem so scary anymore. \n\nFor those of you who find the visuals and soundtrack important for your experience, DD delivers. The audio is great, both the music/ambient and the narrator. The spoken lines and the battle music really get to you and stay in your head, and the low-light soundtrack is spine chilling in certain circumstances. The visuals are gritty, dark and down-to-earth. No knight in shining armor, rather a leper or a kleptomaniac crusader. It makes you appreciate the human nature of the characters and everything creates a distinct low fantasy atmospehere, reminiscent of Warhammer Fantasy.\n\nI don't think there's a point in going into the depths of game mechanics and individual cases of stuff. I will just sum it all up, saying that Darkest Dungeon is a game balancing well on the scales of fun and difficulty. Even with its sometimes dull grinding for a specific item or leveling up a character, it keeps you hooked enough to keep playing and recreating that Dark Souls sort of satisfaction when you finally cross a milestone. The hurtful, \"I've spent so much time on this but it was worth it\" kind of smile.\n\nEdit: added the audiovisual section", "author_steamid": "76561198086145327", "author_num_games_owned": 101, "author_num_reviews": 1, "author_playtime_forever": 4231, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 4231, "author_last_played": "2019-06-06T18:52:05+00:00"}

I've lost heroes because of my own mistakes, underestimating opponents (fucking Ancient Webbers), and (rarely) RNGesus, but it's never been because the game was too stacked against me.\n\nTo earn gold, you HAVE to budget. In early stages, when you're upgrading your Hamlet, you have to learn when Heroes are more trouble than they're worth and to let them go (i.e. their stress reduction cost total > the gold you're taking in, too many diseases, bad quicks that are locked in, etc). Everyone in the beginning is expendable. The overall goal is to accumulate wealth and upgrade that Hamlet. \n\nSimply said, you're not going to get to level 6 on your Heroes from the very beginning. \n\nAfter a while, gold and upgrading become less of an issue. Gold farming is incredibly easy to the Champion level dungeon runs (presuming you survive), with 15K gold as a reward for completing it, and it cost me about 4K to get more than enough supplies to survive. Adding in all the loot that I got (around 14k on my last run), the difference is real. Putting in about 6K in stress reduction, and 4K in quick-removal/disease removal, I still came out on top.\n\nEven with the ease of gold farming in later stages of the game, your Heroes can AND WILL die. I lost nearly an entire party of level 6 Heroes to Webbers because I had gotten into a \"click, kill\" mentality, and thought that the blight damage would be under control. Wrong. \n\nYou have to think about each move you make, because every encounter has the possibilty of going south.\n\nUpdate (Jan 5 2016): I'm very pleased that the featured reviews are all recommended like this game deserves, instead of the people who raged when updates happened and couldn't think critically about it.", "author_steamid": "76561198040225003", "author_num_games_owned": 506, "author_num_reviews": 78, "author_playtime_forever": 13304, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 4453, "author_last_played": "2022-10-15T00:52:25+00:00"}

The team behind it has done a great job.\n \nIt's impossible to discuss Darkest Dungeon without praising the beautifully stark art direction; it channels the deep shadows of Mike Mignola (of \"Hellboy\") perfectly, and the colors shift and suppurate everywhere from the doomed hamlet at the foot of the Darkest Dungeon to the deepest and most Godforsaken pit you'll chuck adventurers into like a wood chipper. The music deftly changes between ominous, somber, and stirring as the situation demands, and the narrator keeps the tone set wonderfully, commenting (though not annoyingly so) on every turn of fate in a Tony Jay timbre.\n \nEven putting aside the excellent and cohesive creative vision on display, the core mechanics of Darkest Dungeon are brutally satisfying. You'll begin the game tentatively sending small, untested and largely unfamiliar adventurers (I really suggest you not bother naming the poor souls yet) on short jaunts through nightmarish corridors -- keep the torch brightly lit in these beginning forays! -- in the hopes that some of them will back come out the other end with cash and relics to upgrade your town, relax and medicate your mercenaries, and keep the gears (the pulping, threshing gears) of your little dungeon-centric industry going.\n \nThe dungeons themselves are hesitant strolls punctuated by combat where every single point of health and stress counts. Darkest Dungeon keeps its numbers small: it'll be exciting when the Leper smacks a bandit for 11 damage, whether or not the Crusader heals for 4 points will be a matter or life and death, and the first time the Bounty Hunter gets a critical hit on a Marked target with Collect Bounty, 40 damage will seem miraculous. The first three-digit enemy will be more than a little worrisome. The RNG is still as fickle as ever though, so be prepared for even the best-laid plans to get ruined by bad luck.\n \nThose tools at your disposal -- the mercenaries -- are a really great puzzle in themselves, too. Where should each fighter stand? What skills can even be used where they're standing? Is it too risky to have a mercenary who's useless if he's knocked out of position by a spell or an ambush? Is having a mercenary who can act in every position going to leave him spread thin? If you put two skills on an adventurer that can only be used in the very back row, what happens if someone in the party dies and there IS no back row? Should you send a very stressed Occultist with a fresh group of mercenaries and risk him driving them ALL mad? Is it safe to send a half-useless and untested Jester with three experienced pigstickers if it means his death will ruin their morale?\n \nThis decision-making only gets worse (better) as the game goes on, and opens you up to a really great obligation to constantly shift, rearrange, retrain and reassess your bands of brethren. Missions will get longer, necessitating that your heroes stop to camp and comfort each other with incense, mockery, medicine, or prayer. As you start to get a few of your hires to a higher level of skill and bravery, sometimes so high that they'll refuse some missions as being beneath their abilities, the management of the town transforms from a largely between-dungeons concern to a much greater part of the metagame.\n \nYou'll swap afflicted but useful madmen in and out of the sanitarium and make decisions on whether it's more pertinent to cure your Bounty Hunter's accuracy-ruining case of The Yips or purge him of Deviant Tastes apparently so unspeakable he's not allowed at the brothel.\n \nYou'll wish a million painful deaths on the Caretaker because he took the last seat at the bar and your Hellion who's psychologically coming apart at the seams -- the Hellion that you NEED for the next outing -- can't relax with anything but a tall tankard.\n \nYou'll stare at the weekly report that tells you than your Crusader, who you sent to meditate his cares away, decided to leave the hamlet on a vision quest and take his holy wrath with him when otherwise your whole 'A-team' skeleton demolition crew is ready to go.\n \nThe town influences your quests into the subterranean meat grinders and vice versa. Parties that before seemed perfect will be split up because the Grave Digger needs her Rabies cured and the Plague Doctor's medicines seem more appealing when faced with the Blight-dripping porcine residents of the Warrens. It keeps the player out of complacency in a really satisfying way; fans of X-COM or other high-stakes strategy will love the feeling of having to scramble in the face of disaster or cut their losses and tell the veteran Vestal and Leper to abandon the quest as well as the bodies of their compatriots.\n \nDarkest Dungeons is a satisfying, strategic game about risk, reward, and reanimation. The dungeon crawls revitalize a task that's otherwise become almost a joke; there's no hazardous smashing through pinata baddies filled with loot here, and each time you hit 'Embark' you'll never really be sure what will be left of your party, if anything at all. The town management is a compelling game of its own, echoing \"worker placement\" board games and charming you as you hone blades, upgrade skills, and wrangle holy alcoholics into their barstools.\n \nThere's still some rough edges from Early Access here and there. Placeholder dialogue pops up occasionally and the central story has been held off until it's done, but even unfinished and in a mostly sandbox state both halves of Darkest Dungeon interact with other in a way that'll have you coming back for more. More, and more, and more, until in the folly of your hubris, the keening susurrations within the deepest abominable chambers beneath your lineage's empty-eyed manse ring out across the blighted land in an unendurable cacophony of gibbering and most terrible doom.", "author_steamid": "76561197985827338", "author_num_games_owned": 772, "author_num_reviews": 5, "author_playtime_forever": 1579, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": 843, "author_last_played": "2018-06-22T02:52:12+00:00"}

The narration and theme are amazing and consistent and add a ton.\n\nThe concept works really well. Rebuilding the town with dungeon crawlers as your expendables fits \"money run\" or \"artifact run\" into the theme of the game so even when you are grinding for something it still feels like a natural progression. \n\nThe balance is (IMO) really good.
