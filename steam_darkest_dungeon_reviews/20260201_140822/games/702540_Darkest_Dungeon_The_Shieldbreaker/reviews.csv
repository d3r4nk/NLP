Tips and tricks for the interested:

-I loved using a modified Coach to get a Lvl 2 or higher Shieldbreaker just to send on short missions to level up the rest of my fodder-er, my up and coming group. It avoids camping and makes the best use of her in my opinion

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️☆☆ (8/10)

[i] Darkest Dungeon: The Shieldbreaker[/i] is a great DLC class. She’s a highly tactical, high-risk, high-reward assassin with strong self-sufficiency, great mobility, and top-tier utility. The Shieldbreaker adds depth to your roster, but she also adds pressure with powerful movement and DOT skills balanced by low HP and a unique stress mechanic.

🐍 [b]Pros:[/b]
[list]
[*] Unique and tactical combat style. The Shieldbreaker thrives on movement and DOTs (Damage Over Time), with an incredibly dynamic kit that rewards careful positioning. Her Pierce, Puncture, and Adders' Kiss abilities bypass enemy protections and shred backline threats.

[*] High mobility. She can move forward or back while staying deadly, which makes her ideal for comps that mess with position or fight in chaotic dungeons like the Courtyard or Farmstead. Her ability to remain effective across all ranks makes her super flexible.

[*] Armor-piercing and debuff-focused. She's built to counter tough enemies with high PROT or annoying guard mechanics. Against enemies that turtle up, she’s an MVP.

[*] Built-in narrative and challenge. The Shieldbreaker has a unique “Nightmare” mechanic tied to camping. At random (unless turned off), she’ll relive traumatic memories through challenging ambushes that test your squad. It adds flavor, tension, and lore to your runs.

[*] Rich backstory and flavor. Her past is haunting and detailed, revealed through journal entries unlocked by surviving Nightmare battles. It adds narrative weight to an already compelling character.
[/list]

 😰[b] Cons:[/b]
[list]
[*] The Nightmares can be brutal. While flavorful, the camping ambushes can wreck an unprepared team. Until you’re familiar with them, they’re a major risk, especially on longer expeditions.

[*] Very low HP and stress-vulnerable. She’s fragile, and because she suffers extra stress damage from Nightmare battles, it’s easy to lose her if you’re careless. You need to build your team with stress healing or anti-ambush strategies.

[*] High skill floor. Her toolkit is powerful but demands finesse. If you don’t manage positioning or forget to build around her DOT strategy, she’ll underperform or die fast.

Whenever you camp and have a Shieldbreaker on your team there is a chance for her to have a nightmare where your team has to fight snakes. I like the nightmare fights especially since at the end of all of them shieldbreaker gets a free buff whenever she camps and the snakes are fun to fight. The only stuff I don't like about the nightmares is there is no music for them and shieldbreaker takes 20 stress every round. I just wish Stuart Chatwood would've made a new track for the nightmares I know it'd be small but it would've been a chance to do something different with the music in this game which would've been really cool instead of just hearing the wind howl as your heros battle nightmare snakes.

With that said, the new shieldbreaker class has more baggage to it than it brings to the table.

The basic idea of the shieldbreaker is all in the name.  She specializes in dealing with those armored enemies.  In a void, she would be a great character that fit right in, but in the game as it is now, she is a burden not worth the hassle of bringing her along.

A few points I would like to make, they are:  

1. She can do some blight damage, which, with the release of CC, isn't as useful as often as bleed is (I get it, the snake theme...)  The problem with this is the CC expansion itself.  You bring your shieldbreaker into the ruins thinking its a good fit, but once those CC enemies start popping up, you will wonder why you picked any blight skills at all. (Granted, this happens to the PD as well, but PD has far more other tricks)

2. The skills don't see to really make her a better pick than other strong bleed/blighters to take down armored foes.  This serves into the biggest point yet...

3. If you camp with her, she will be in for a world of pain.  It's a 100% fight.  She will get to 100 stress before its over.  You will almost assuredly walk out of camping with a shieldbreaker far, far worse than you did when you camped in the first place.

4. The highwayman seems to have far better abilities that forward 1 and back 1, and even a melee bleed for the armored mobs.  Upon comparing the two, AEGIS looks great on paper, but you have to forgo a round to get it, and it only blocks actual damage, not stress or other non damaging attacks.

To summarize, I enjoyed the lore, the look, and the idea of the shieldbreaker, but the actual execution of this class leaves it in the mud at the wheel of the stage coach.  

I love DD, but sadly, I have mod classes that i'd pay $4 for before the shieldbreaker.",76561198047918382,0,12,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

Shieldbreaker class is fun to play with, serving as a sort of glass-cannon with a few interesting blight/armor ignoring attacks to deal with high protection enemies, along with her Serpent's Sway, a limited use ability that prevents all damage from the next two attacks. However, it should be clarified that the new monsters come up in an ambush that can only occur when you use her; they're not encountered beyond that scope, and it's kind of annoying. Imagine, if you will, the Collector mini-boss could only show up whenever you camped with the Flagellant. It's an interesting battle, but kind of gamey and arbitrary in its application, and that's how it feels here to me. Hopefully a mod turns it into a general encounter like has been done with the Shrieker, but until then;

Anyway, the Shieldbreaker is a very fun and powerful class, and you can do a lot of great stuff with her. I personally had the most fun when I sent two in the Cove and spammed Impale. If a battle isn't over by turn three, there's a problem.

Unfortunately for everyone, but mostly for the review ratio, having a Shieldbreaker in your party will spawn a guaranteed fight upon camping, and the Shieldbreaker will suffer from massive horror, pretty much guaranteeing an affliction.
Except that's wrong, and here's how you make these fights a cakewalk.
- There are only seven of them. The fourth and fifth only appear in Veteran difficulty at least, and the sixth and seventh won't until Champion difficulty. Which means you're in the clear if you're done with the first three and you want to do a Medium/Long Lvl 1 Mission, for example.
- Your SB will suffer 23 stress for 6 rounds. So using the camping skill Pep Talk a few times, and bringing a stress healer along will pretty much negate it.
- The enemies were made to be countered by the SB's skills. Use Expose on stealthed enemies to kill them extremely fast, use the armor piercing skills (and the armor piercing bonus from the camping skills), just play smart.

I could keep going but honestly, I don't think I need to. Any solid team with a Jester for stress heals will most likely destroy any of these guys.

It's true. Her unique ""encounters"" at night can quickly drive her to insanity. I feel like reviews are too harsh on her and gloss over some details:
1) While her encounters are annoying, they only appear a certain number of times per difficulty. Each time you beat the encounter you get one of her trinkets, and I think this is the only way to get the trinkets.

2) The encounters aren't difficult. The unique enemies in the fight aren't tough or particularly hard hitting, its just a DPS race to prevent the shieldbreaker from going insane. 

3) The shieldbreaker herself is unique and fairly fun to play. She brings a little bit of everything to the table with AOE damage, DOTS, direct damage and a lot of front row self shuffling. A side effect of the shuffling is that she doesn't remain out of position for long if pushed to the back.

4) She brings new mechanics to the table that others don't. While she doesn't deal as much damage as a highwayman or arbalest, she does have the unique ability to penetrate PROT directly AND bypass Guard entirely, even breaking the guard to allow others to follow up. This can dramatically change the tactics of some of the games harder fights.

I want to note that all this is in a week 106ish normal difficulty run, I have not tried her on Radiant or Stygian. Two spoiler tips for the Shieldbreaker: Her horror effect in the nightmare cannot be cleansed by the new supply item for some reason, and when she has a resolve test in the nightmare it is always an affliction. She cannot roll a virtue in it. I don't know if she can't get virtues at all, I haven't had a shieldbreaker have their resolve tested outside the nightmare.",76561198010303717,0,39,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

On any camping mission, you will get an unavoidable ambush called a nightmare, in which a bunch of really powerful snake enemies attack your party, and the shieldbreaker gets a HUGE stress dot.  If you don't have a party capable of killing the snakes fast enough or a jester, your entire mission will be over.  If you beat it, you get a trinket of varying quality and a story tidbit.
The nightmare ambushes for this class restrict the part building so severely that she's almost zero fun to play.  In short missions she really shines, but everywhere else, she is a huge liability.

In addition to her abilities, you will also encounter a handful of new enemies associated with her backstory and a droppable loot item that can be very helpful for other heroes.

I am not a big fan of the newly introduced stealth mechanic which makes some enemies untargetable for the first 2 turns unless their stealth is removed via one of the special skills. However, since this update was included into the base game at the time of this DLC's release, you'll be affected by this mechanic either way, so it's better to have an extra class that can deal with stealthy enemies. Aside from the Shieldbreaker, only 5 other hero classes have a skill that can De-Stealth enemies, 3 of which are pretty poor skills that you wouldn't normally equip to a hero that has them anyway. So you'll be very restricted in what classes to bring to the late game dungeons. I personally think it would be nicer if the devs added de-stealth skills to a few more hero classes, so not to restrict the party setup too much.

A pretty small DLC overall, but since it's pretty cheap and since the new hero class is pretty awesome, I'd say it's worth getting, though not necessary to enjoy the base game.",76561197989390503,675,211,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

The section below includes spoilers detailing some of the content of this DLC.


[spoiler]The Shieldbreaker is most likely the best damage dealing class in the game, the majority of her abilities are very good but the best one is Pierce, which completely ignores enemy protect, and can target any rank. Early on this may not seem that good, but especially later in the game enemies with high Protect stat are fairly common. She's also extremely good in the endless harvest quest for the same reason.

As a penance for this you must suffer 7 special ambush fights after camping with the SB in your party. Once completed they will not repeat and you will be free to use SBs everywhere all the time. Each successful fight will also reward you with an exclusive trinket. Be sure to put some camping stress reduction buffs on her if expecting these nightmares.",76561198155556619,342,81,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

Straight to the point. Is the Shieldbreaker good? Yes. Very good. So much so that I'd say she's one of the best characters in the game (even considered to be one of the only truly ""viable"" heroes in a good team composition in The Color of Madness, but that's a story for another review). Hard-hitting abilities that can disable enemies or just shred through their defenses, being able to cause some heavy constant blight damage to one enemy (or even all of them!) while also being able to move through your team composition without ever really finding herself in a ""useless"" position, I liked this character. Her design is also great, although I believe that her shield is barely used considering she's more focused on dodging than taking on the blows. Character art is great but of course it'd be great. This is Darkest Dungeon after all. Her story was also very interesting to learn about and seeing the dynamic of ""broken yet beautiful"", having to throw a part of her body ""away"" so she could truly be free, although I find weird that she thanks her ""liberator"" but then has nightmares about snakes.

The Shieldbreaker has one big ""problem"" (or convenience, later on) though, every time you camp with a Shieldbreaker in your team, your team will be automatically ambushed by enemies related to the Shieldbreaker past, while also heavily stressing the SB for every turn while in the camp fight. This is particularly punishing in the early-game, considering that camping is one of the few occasions where you actually feel ""safe"" to a certain degree in (at least the normal) game and just when you thought everything was good you get instead attacked by these scaly beasts it can really feel annoying. The good thing is that after seven of those lovely encounters every time you camp with the SB she finds comfort in having found... comfort from the demons of her past and gains some nice small buffs. So you basically suffer on the early-game to bet buffs at late-game... which isn't that nice considering that by late-game you barely have anything to worry about with your heroes all tanked up and ready to challenge [b]GOD[/b].

Some short words about the new enemies from this DLC: Pliskin - WILL blight you. Also hard to hit. Rattler - I hate these guys with a passion. Prepare to be slapped back for every slap you do. Adder - Annoying. Will heal, will stun and will laugh at you before being poked. Also! When you defeat all of SB's nightmares you can rarely find them roaming around which is a nice lil thing. Adds some extra diversity to places, although I can see that being annoying to some. They drop the new item though which... can help. Kinda.

The new item added in this DLC is called the Aegis Scale and it is... ok. They work by basically giving you a ""total block"" for one attack that hits your character. They don't shield against Stress though so they can feel kinda underwhelming, even more so when you use one of them to prepare for a hard-hitting attack and get hit by a weak one. This could be more blamed on the RNG side of the game but still, I wish they at least made you resist 50% of the normal Stress damage you'd receive.

Overall, The Shieldbreaker DLC is a great DLC that, although going the extra mile, just feels underwhelming for what it brings out to the table or just straight up punishing in some occasions.

I feel like the price point is fair, as you get a few new machanics with this character, and she is of high quality and adds a lot to the vanilla roster, but there are too many things bringing it down.

For one, everytime you bring the shieldbreaker with you, you get a sort of special nightmare ambush every single time you camp with her. Yes, every time. There's no way to avoid this, not even character abilities that avoid an ambush at night will stop them. You're forced into a difficult fight each time. Not only this, but she suffers from heavy stress throughout the encounter. There are ways to avoid this, but it's still annoying. The fight itself is with snakes that can dish out both bleed and blight attacks and some have heavy PROT as well for defense. Best yet, because you're guaranteed to fight these snakes each time you bring her, you'll only want to bring her to an area like the Weald or the Warrens, where you'll encounter many beast enemies just so that your party will be prepared for beast type enemies. If you bring her to the Ruins or the Cove, (where she's ironically a strong character as she's able to dish out blight damage, has armor piercing for the high PROT enemies there, and has some attacks that can shut down annoying back row enemies) it's likely that your party won't be prepared for enemies that have high blight resist and count as beast-type enemies. This whole thing would honestly be way better if she had a camping skill that could avoid this, or if you had the option to skip the fight.

The armor piercing and block mechanics are both interesting. Armor piercing thankfully adds yet another way to get around PROT and blocks are a fun way to make your tank characters even more tanky, or make your squishy back row heroes get one free attack to ignore. Guard break is another great idea to add as it provides a way to get around enemies protecting other enemies.

Stealth is meh. Like, really meh. Not many enemies outside of the snakes mentioned above use it, and it's just more of a pest than anything I feel needs to be carefully planned for or taken into consideration.

In the end, it's left to buyer discretion. I would have prefered a third option instead of yes or no. I think I'll enjoy keeping her, but only because a mod recently came out a few days ago that gets rid of the nighttime ambush and adds the snakes to the generic enemy roster, as well as adding the character's trinkets to the existing trinket roster, as the fight itself gets tiring and just makes things too complicated.

I found many discussions online whether she is OP or not. Even the ones who think she is not OP still thinks she is S-tier hero. The only her problem is the defense, but there are many ways to solve the issue easily. But her damage is just crazy and her utilities are so good too. Especially, in champion difficulty, she can do much better damage than all other heroes.

All her skills are very good, but particularly her first (the most basic) skill, Pierce, is just only one perfect skill. Because of the skill, you don't need to use your brain. You simply can finish this game if you just pierce all the monsters (even boss monsters) until the end of the game with two or three shieldbreakers and a vestal in the party. You don't need any other strategies, because that simple strategy is better than any. I have no idea why they leave this unbalanced OP hero. This game is not fun because of this hero.

The Shieldbreaker also meshes perfectly with the game's aesthetics, has powerful abilities and works well in high movement compositions. She shreds the Cove alive, is decent in the Weald, and has some mark synergies. The only complaint I have is that the health could stand to be ever so slightly higher, by maybe three or four? She is rather squishy, which necessitates some compositional sacrifices.

The content and especially the class are quite nice and bring some fresh air, but even if its only 4€, that work could have been done by like 2-3 community mods. i would rather want to get more content similar to crimson court and make it a 10€ expansion that is really worth it.

-said ambush only happens when you have a shieldbreaker on your team

look below for a more thought out and better review

Now to be frank for a moment, panda leaving the scene and cynical frank sitting down, I admit I am irked by one thing about this dlc. Aegis doesn't prevet bleed or blight and is lost easily to any barely or even non-damaging stress attack and it blocking it doesn't to squat about the stress. That said, I'm absolutely 100% okay with it. Logically if I block something lunging at me with my shield in a way where no damage is recieved it wouldn't affect me with any of it's nasty debilitating effects but this is a game about eldritch horror an antedeluvian nightmares, logically none of it makes sense....

...but that is part of the beauty of it in vanilla, CC, and Shieldbreaker. Now, what can shield breaker do?


Aegis
Doesn't block bleed, blight, stress, debuff, or marked
DOES block stuns, push, and pull AND UP FRONT DAMAGE. I'd rather have a character that I can have stay where I want them, have not take 34-50 damage from a boss letting loose a massively damaging attack, and be able to use a bandage or antivenom or medicinal herbs or holy water to deal with the DoT and debuffs when it is their turn again over one that is put in a place where it can either do little or nothing or just sit there like a deer in headlights until it's next turn.

Armour piercing attacks are AWESOME they are so much help against all these enemies with armour, you don't really notice the difference at first but when you do you REALLY do,

She is always shifting and this works exceptionally with characters like jester and grave robber that either can or love to shift themselves all over the place (occultist too, he is pretty much able to use 3-4 of his abilities in every space)

she can yank someone into the front and make it so that nobody can guard them and I love this so much! it really helps in fights against enemies who constantly like to guard their allies like the octocestus gents and the collector's version of the man at arms

stealth may not seem like much but I really appreciate it that so many character abilities can unstealth enemies and that ones that hit multiple spaces don't even need them to unstealth to hit them. It just adds a little, ""no no, not yet"" to the characters. then again I'm almost always using an occultist healer with vulnerability hex. Besides, it's not a big issue as people freak out over it being because none of the vanilla bosses, bosses, big bad enemies, minibosses, or any of the Crimson Court enemies can stealth. Probably because the big ones are too fat, tall, or stompy stompy, and because the crimson court ones are almost always making some insectile noise and are slobbering so much over their next meals.

She has 3 blight skills, one which doesn't blight for the first two levels but hits all enemy spaces for EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD group damage, one which only affects the front 2 slots but really nicely punishes them for being in those spaces with really good blight damage and the fact that she alreay does good base damage and said skill has no damage penalty, and my favourite one of all, captivate.

If you are bringing in a Shieldbreaker for her damage you had better damn make sure (if you're going to have them be in the second slot) that you have a character who can mark opponents because she is GREAT for a team based around marking foes.

Now that I've gone over the good, let's go over the thing everyone won't stop talking about... the BAD.


skip to beneath this paragraph for the actual review of the bad
...... the whole game is bad.... every element of it, every enemy, hero, ability, skill, and so on is bad. That is the point of this game's difficulty, MAKING THE BEST OF A BAD SITUATION INVOLVING ELDRTICH HORRORS THE LIKES OF WHICH DRIVE MEN TO MURDER AND MADNESS. If you've completed the darkest dungeon you know exactly what I'm talking about and the fate of your ancestor! Also, no that's not a spoiler because it's the ending of the game. He called you to his ruined estate. You hear him ALL THE TIME commenting on your combat or the hamlet or something he remembers or something else like that. Of course his story is going to be a part of the climax and resolution, it's common sense.


The 3 snake enemies..... they're fine in my eyes. the cobra is annoyingly invisible and always punching you with it's fangs, but it is fine because he can be killed quickly and blight is an element you can ALWAYS deal with. Just outheal it's blight damage or bring a plague doctor to cure anyone who gets blighted (remember, plague doctor curing someone cures the patient AND the doctor herself)
The second snake is a pain. It's okay to fight, but I don't like it having protection and riposte but can understand it because it's a snake, I just don't like it being able to guard others but whenever an enemy guards another one that I'm trying to kill of course it irks me because I have to kill them first and that is fine. This isn't a game played best in Radiant mode, it's a game played best in normal mode (at least in my opinion) and I'm actually glad that I started playing this game before they added the difficulty options.
The third snake enemy is the same as any miniboss to fight, just kill it quickly and you'll be fine.

Finally the nightmares. You fight some relatively okay to fight enemies, they WON'T happen if you've got something that prevents nightime ambush and even if you don't it will only happen 7 times. encounters 1-3 happen at the normal/easy/whatever the difficulty is called runs, encounters 4-5 happen in veteran runs, and encounters 6-7 happen only on champion difficulty runs. Just don't bring her along to fight a boss for the appropriate difficulty until you've done the encounters available on that appropriate difficulty. the nightmare encounters (each level of them) will only ever happen ONCE. you need to prepare for this because until all the ones for that difficulty dungeon are done it will happen so it is best to do what you can WITHOUT the campfire until you're near the end of the dungeon and do NOT bring her along on a x2 length dungeon until they are done. it is really that simple.

Finally, this did come after the Crimson court, but it is simply a new character addition and you shouldn't be reviewing or reacting to how well you do with one in the courtyard based on it coming after. you can also enable and disable dlc as much as you please from the menu by clicking the little yellow arrow pointing down.

Overall, this isn't any sort of problematic or stupid or overpowered thing added to the game in my opinion, it is just a new character you can enjoy that is well worth it. Even if you don't there is still the steam refund, you can remove the dlc from your account permanently if you want, and you can also just disable it.",76561198098646568,0,106,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

What she brings:
- Lots of movement. All her skills move her around the party and she can be used on positions 1-4.
- A pierce ability that can attack on all enemy positions, making her extremely usefull against high prot targets.
- 3 blight abilitys, 2 single target strong ones and one weaker that hits all 4 enemies at once.
- Can de-stealth enemies
- Can give herself 2 Block, a new buff that blocks the dmg from a hit she takes.
- Can break guard
- High base speed stat
Drawbacks:
- Less HP then other frontliners
- Strongest in position 1+2, but no ability to buff resistances or prot
- Lowest blight resistance (20%)
- Camping potentially breaking the run (more below)

The unique feature of the shieldbreaker is her nightmares. When you camp, you have a 50% chance for her nightmares to manifest and force a fight with a new enemy type: snakes. (can't be prevented)
These snake fights come in 7 encounter. If you win an encounter, the next one of the 7 may spawn on the next camping. Once all encounters have been defeated, the shieldbreaker has conquered her nightmares and gets a strong camping buff every camp. This encounter progress is shared across all shieldbreakers, so you only have to win an ecounter once.

These snake encounters are hard to beat, since you loose automatically once shieldbreaker either reaches deaths door or gets an affliction. This is made harder with an incurable stress debuff that gives her 25 stress per round and snakes being more likely to attack the shieldbreaker. It is adviced to use -% stress camping buffs on the shieldbreaker to give yourself 1-2 extra rounds to finish the fight as well as 1 other stealth-breaking hero and a way to clear the numerous strong blights that the snakes will dish out.

To understand what she brings to the table, you need to look at what else the DLC brings. Most notably, this DLC introduces a stealth mechanic. Various enemies, such as the Weald witches and the Coves' Pelagic Shaman, can now begin encounters stealthed, which means they cannot be targeted by single-target abilities for several turns. They can still be hit by AoE abilities however, and they can be prematurely revealed by certain hero abilities. Naturally the Shieldbreaker comes with an ability that can do this, but existing characters are now capable of doing so, such as the Arbalest with her Rallying Flare. In addition, the Grave Robber can now stealth herself using her Shadow Fade ability, further adding to her already plentiful bag of dirty tricks.

The Shieldbreaker herself is nothing to sneeze at. In keeping with her backstory as a dancer, her moves heavily rely on shifting her through your party's ranks, and you will likely need to build your party composition around her as a result. For obvious reasons, she partners well with the Grave Robber. The Shieldbreaker is capable of blighting entire enemy formations, ignoring an enemy's PROT and therefore their damage mitigation, exploting Marked enemies, giving herself stacks of Block to ignore attacks outright, and as noted above, bypassing Stealth. Perhaps most importantly, she has the completely unique ability to bypass an enemy's Guarded status and pull them forward in the same action, nullifying the protective abilities of enemies such as the Pelagic Guardian or the Courtyard's Servants.

In exchange for all this, the Shieldbreaker comes with a unique drawback. She is haunted by her past in a far more literal fashion then her fellows. After camping out in a dungeon, there is a 50% chance the SB may be overcome by nightmares of the incident in which she lost her hand, and the party will be attacked by monstrous snake enemies with who variously have nasty Blights, Stealth, Crits and Riposte capability. This battle is of timed duration and inflicts the poor SB with a crippling Horror debuff that cannot be dispelled with Laudanum. If the party fails to defeat the snakes in time they will be inflicted with a nasty stress debuff for the remainder of that quest, the SB recieving a harsher one plus an Accuracy penalty. However, if the snakes are defeated, You will recieve a character-specific trinket for the SB, a unique consumable Scale item that can grant a stack of block to any character, and a big stress buff for the whole party, with the SB receiving a greater one plus a Crit Chance bonus. Defeating all seven of the encounters, each of which has a fixed group of snakes, results in ALL Shieldbreakers you own receiving a unique buff whenever you camp out- She has conquered her fears at last. You will also have collected all her trinkets this way, including her set trinkets.

If you additionally have the Crimson Court DLC, the Shieldbreaker can gain the benefits of the Training Ring District, receiving bonus accuracy and maximum HP.

I do not know if this was intended, but the Shieldbreaker makes an ideal party member for the subsequent Color of Madness DLC. Together with a Highwayman, Jester and Vestal, I was able to reach 300 kills in the new endless mode with no losses and only the Vestal becoming Afflicted at one point.",76561197970739339,775,607,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

What's more, I found the character interesting as a person, and a great take take on a both a regional and cultural motiff. Another Mediterranean-Middle Eastern character on the roster is nice to see.

[b]The first[/b]: The dream sequences are really fun. I can't wait for a ""Darkest Journeys"" sequal, where we get more beautiful scenery and landscapes. 

[b]The second[/b]: The character is fun, and the character herself is aesthetically well-designed. However, I thought the snake motif animations around her skills were a bit heavy-handed, and even a bit garish compared to other characters. Even her default thrust, her spear glows with almost magic light, or when she throws, her javalin becomes a magic poison projectile.... it's a bit blatant for the world. Even the Occultist has a regular knife attack.

[b]The third[/b]: There's a bit too much revealed backstory. All the classes are sort of self-explained trope-characters. We can infer from how they speak, what they reference, how they look like, what the [i]feel[/i] of their backstory is. They don't [i]need[/i] explicit backstories, as if the classes are all [i]literally[/i] a single character. 

In the Shieldbreaker's case, she's missing a hand that she wraps a shield around. How did that happen? Did she escape manacles by cutting her hand off? Did a tyrant remove it as punishment? Was she shielding someone from a blow? Was she a princess? A slave? Does it matter? No, it's all part of the mystique of a character, maybe to be hinted at opaquely in resting dialogue.

Unfortunately, you find journals that tell you [i]explicitly[/i] what happened, and I feel that takes away some of the mystique, some of the sense of them as a [i]class[/i] of character. I thought the trinket flavor text of the Crimson Court managed this well, a sense of discovery, lots to the imagination. 

Lastly, it wasn't immediately clear what motivations she might have to be in the Hamlet, fighting evil, etc. Nor was it clear why she was a ""Shieldbreaker"" and not a Nomad or Odalisque or Beduin or any number of more atmosophere- and character-consistent alternatives. (And of all characters to have an invulnerability spell... it didn't really feel consistent like the other classes.)

As an experiment with a new class, this DLC is totally fine and fun to mess with. If they do another [i]exactly[/i] like it, I feel it will be a mistep.

And again, all the [i]good[/i] aspects all highlights the possibility for wonderous fun that awaits Darkest Dungeon when they make a sequal or a fresh campaign.

The mechanics are all wonderful and (I would argue) should have been a part of the original game. Armor Piercing ignores PROT, making the Shieldbreaker able to directly attack those enemies you used to have to stack Blight and Bleed on. Guard Break allows you to pull a target out of position and remove the Guard status another creature is protecting it with. Stealth prevents monsters (and heroes) from being attacked.

The new enemies are a few snakes (Beasts) that appear scattered lightly throughout the levels. But their main use is as enemies in the Shieldbreaker's Nightmares. Unlike all other heroes, this character will automatically trigger an ambush during camping on Medium or Long missions. The encounters progress through a story-based series of seven chapters, and defeating each one rewards the party with loot and buffs. This makes the hero a real liability in Boss missions.

The Shieldbreaker herself quickly became one of my favorite classes. She has relatively low HP, but features a couple of very strong defensive abilities, and is a master of weaving in and out of different positions in your lineup (""Dancing and fighting - there is no difference"", she says).

While the flagellant is an OP character, not only is he required for the harsh battles in the crimson court, but to ordinary players, he can be just as a liability as he can be powerful. He was a character that rose the skill ceiling allowing people to perform amazing feats in the game without being game breakingly OP for ordinary players or having any liabilities that could not be circumnavigated in the hands of competent players (such as the conditional nature of his healing)


The shieldbreaker is different. Her liability is a 100% event ambush that is more unfair unless one forgoes camping.

Note: this ambush is an unfair one as it adds on a tonne of stress (enough to afflict) unto any shieldbreakers.
Personally, i am a person who doesn't think the shieldbreaker is overly OP. The ability to negate all damage, for the most part, isn't that powerful since, she is still susceptible to dots (The biggest killers IMO since you cant negate that damage without flagellant's regen skill) and stress. The only true times where id consider it useful is with the prophet, as his damage is extreme. I.e Its hard to predict damage so blocking for a single ally isnt that OP. Her damage and guard removal is pretty well balanced with her lack of health

 While i know its possible (and this is probably going to be my strategy if this isn't changed) , i think that removing such an integral part of gameplay for the sake of a character doesn't feel right. Additionally, it constricts a party to a non-camping style requiring a jester, houndmaster or crusader to lower the stress.

Personally, i would change it to give a stock 20 stress damage dealt to the character and have enemies deal stress damage to only Shieldbreakers in a similar way to revelation deals damage to people without trinkets in the DD. 

Don't get this until this becomes irrelavant as this character is fun, but a liability.

Now, I'll preface the whole review by saying that whilst I don't have that many hours on DD in Steam, I can safely assure anybody reading that I have a very deeply mechnical understanding of the way DD is supposed to play, be it through many (shady) playthroughs and watching guides and gameplay.

So now let's actually get into the Shieldbreaker.

Being a DLC that has only one major addition, the price for it is a tad over what it should be. While $4 is nothing spectacular it is a bit too much for a glorified character pack. So right off the bat I can say that It's not a worthwhile buy if it isn't on sale, simply because it doesn't add enough content to make it worthwhile.

The character on the other hand, hoo boy. For starters this class ends up being one of those classes. The ones where putting them in a LV1 dungeon and putting them in a LV6 dungeon is pretty much the same. The abilites the character has are a lot of fun, and they add more movement abilites, which in my personal opinion haven't been explored as much as they should be. Most base game characters only really have movement abilites that are used in situations where they want to move away from a certain rank. Attacks like the Crusader's Holy Lance are just that, since they deal heavily debuffed damage, you'd really only be using it to move forwards. The only classes that do a decent job at moving about are the Highwayman and the Jester, where the Jester is pretty much geared to that sort of playstyle, whilst the Highwayman can pull off the forwards, then backwards manuever pretty well.

The major gripe most people seem to run in with the character is the post-camp encounter. I read a review around here somewhere which explained it better than I could, but in short, the battles are actually preset, so you wouldn't be getting them forever and ever until death do you and her part. Now, the battles themselves. If you hadn't noticed the Shieldbreaker  had also shipped with an ability that no other character had up to that point, that being the De-stealthing mechanic. Characters had the stealth ability far before this, and heck, even some enemies in the Crimson Court used it. But no character had been shipped with an ability that is made for destealthing. That's why the encounter is a tad easier, since you're always going to have a Shieldbreaker for the encounter, you can easiely set her skills up so that she's the most effective against the snakes during the fight. Secondly, even if DD can be quite a bitch when it comes to RNG, this battle might be one of the more balanced ones. Aside from the fact that it's all preset from the word go, it's also a very simple set up, one high-damage/low-hp and 2 high-hp/low-damage enemies at first, then they add another high-damage and then there's a miniboss of sorts. But if you're not an idiot you'd know how many times you'd already fought, so figuring out what battle is next, should be a piece of cake. Provided you have the gamesense for it, that is.

From that rambly wall of text, you should more-or-less get the idea, that for a super fun and fluent character you'd be getting a slight challenge, as if you don't face those every time you play the game to begin with.",76561198047918536,576,91,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

She has a unique mix of traits unseen on other classes in addition to a mechanic entirely unique to her. She filled the exact role I needed to make my mark teams work to their full capacity, in addition to having a just plain cool aesthetic. The shieldbreaker has several advantages that improve tactical versatility without being overpowered.

- Armor Piercing. The shieldbreaker's basic attack ignores protection, which becomes extremely important on higher resolve levels. I consider her the best front line character to bring into the cove, hands down.
- Block Mechanic. She can block all of an attack’s raw damage up to four times per battle. It isn’t always worth the opportunity cost, especially because DOTs and conditions still function normally, but in the right circumstances this ability is very helpful.
- Fantastic Range. Her basic attack can hit any enemy rank from any of the first three positions, and she has other abilities that are viable even in the very back. Whether pushed, surprised, or shuffled, she always has options.
- Front Line Blights. The shieldbreaker is the only frontline character capable of inflicting heavy blight damage. This makes her uniquely qualified for the cove: as someone not partial to the leper or crusader, she was a particularly welcome addition to my team.
- High Speed. Speed is the most important stat in the game and the shieldbreaker is very fast. Her unique trinkets can boost her speed even more, almost guaranteeing she strikes first each round.
- Great Mobility. Almost all of the shieldbreaker’s abilities move her forwards or backwards one space. Coupled with her good range, she is a great ally to have when the party gets surprised. As with most movement skills, clever speed management can lead to incredible party combos.
- Mark Synergy. The shieldbreaker is also the only frontline character able to gain bonus damage from marks. If you run with occultists instead of vestals, I cannot recommend her enough.

I would be remiss if I didn’t mention the nightmares. They nightmares are essentially camp ambushes, except that they have unique enemies and give you a stress and damage reduction buff upon completion. There is little getting around it: the nightmares can be bad without preparation, and in Darkest Dungeon perpetration costs resources. You’ll need to give up some camping skills and spend some gold to get multiple sources of the previously useless “pep talk” camping skill; and for better or for worse you’ll probably want to put a stress relief trinket on her too. Her nightmares inflict severe horror on her which cannot be cured by laudanum, and she can’t go virtuous when in a nightmare. What this means is that until you complete all seven nightmares, she will drain a small amount of the rest of your party’s effectiveness due to the effort they need to spend keeping her from going insane. 

Personally, I consider her well worth the cost. The shieldbreaker is my favorite character class: great job, Red Hook!",76561198004419596,0,11,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

Short version: Pretty good but definetely wait for sale.

Long Version: I'll tackle this sequentially by topic.

1) The shieldbreaker herself. She's a really good character with very specific utility. If I had to give an example I would compare her to the occultist. Not usually a damage type but with offensive utility as opposed to the occultist's support utility. She's not a combat trump card, but is still usually useful. Like any character you need to know where to put her and more importantly who to put around her. The fact that she moves with almost every move almost provides an unofficial cooldown on some of her abilities. A well made character in my opinion.

2) The nightmare ambush. I'm treating this as a seperate aspect for one reason. I want more characters to have this! I want the highwayman to see the corpses of the victims in his comic or the man at arms to relive that fateful battle. This unfourtunately feels like a tease having it only happen to the shieldbreaker and is one issue I have with this content. Those journal's are of a similar vein too.

3) The scales. Protects from one hit. In my PS4 runthrough, I never used one. I suferred from 'super powerful item I'll save for the next fight"" syndrome. I know how I would use them, but I never did.

So, why the thumb down if I never said anything extremely negative? The issue I have is that this introduces so many good ideas on one character, like an overpriced apetizer. I though stealth was included in this content but that turned out to be an automatic update. The content has too little of too many good ideas that could be implemented for the rest of the roster. I recommend to people who like the core game to put this on their wishlist so they know when it's on sale.",76561198130041602,0,5,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

Long: Shieldbreaker is a very powerful fighter to add to your roster, if not a bit finicky. See, she deals very good single target damage, both in physical or blight/dot damage. She can easily outperform most dps classes and can have a unique mechanic of fully negating an attack on her throw a new Block mechanic (although it does not stop dot). 

     Most of her moves however move her forward or backwards, hence her class being considered a dancer. This makes it hard to setup with a team that relies on being in certain positions to function, but also means she's versatile enough to be good if she ever gets pushed out of her position.

     Another cool mechanic is her nightmare sequence. She has a deathly fear of snakes, and when camping with her, you may get a nightmare sequence which is a forced ambush with unique snake enemies. These are honestly kinda annoying but so are many enemies. She will actually only get her trinkets from completing these sequences so if u wnat her to get more powerful, don't be afraid!

      Now, if this was it I'd recommend this character; 4 bucks for an entire character and new mechanic is nice. However, with the workshop around, its hard to convince someone to buy it on merit alone. I'd say that there are many cooler characters made by fans but due to many new mechanics added in this one, maybe consider buying it all the same as not owning the dlc for some modded classes breaks the game. It's also just fun and worth it if your going with vanilla gameplay.",76561198043431643,409,46,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

The Shieldbreaker is a cool and creative class that is fun to use. The nightmares that the Shieldbreaker's face shield are interesting and fun in small quantities, after playing too many medium and large size dungeons ruined my experience with these nightmares. 

Let's talk more about the shield breaker as a class though. The Sheildbreaker's main skill is called pierce which has good accuracy, fine crit, fine damage, and ""armour piercing"" as well as moving the character forward one space. This skill shows the two primary features of the Shieldbreaker, which is moving around and destroying armour users. All of the damage based attacks either use blight or armour piercing so they are great against high prot enemies and all of the attacks move the Sheildbreaker.

I love all of the dot(damage over time) based moves, but I do not like all of movement based attacks. Don't get me wrong the movement is welcome in some situations like when you get surprised you can move around and still do damage which is nice but makes building some infeasible. The Sheildbreaker will always end up at the front of the party which makes some matches really hard. It's hard to use with the helion because of Iron Swan, spot two highwayman can be difficult if you use a move that needs to move her back before the highwayman can use duelist advance.

Overall rather good, my favourite DD DLC because it has so little downsides in comparison to the other two 7.5/10",76561198264336132,0,55,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

I picked this DLC up on sale, and have played around with it decent amount. So, basically what happens is that you get a new hero class and two new mechanics, stealth (I'm fairly certain this DLC added them in, at least added more stealth enemies in, and aegis.) Aegis is an interesting mechanic, I'll explain how to get this later, but essentially what aegis does is allows you to make one of your heroes ignore all physical damage for 1 round. They way you obtain these, at least early on, is by camping with the SB in your party. This caught me off guard, and almost ruined my boss run, but you encounter a number of snakes after finishing camping, and these are some mean sons of bitches. After killing them, you get a trinket or two, some other assorted loot, and a few scales that are consumables that grant aegis. Its a really useful thing against a few bosses, the prophet namely. The next mechanic is stealth, and this basically serves to make your life more miserable. It makes it so that the enemy who is stealth cannot be targeted for two rounds unless unstealthed. The SB has an unstealth in his kit, and a few other heroes do like the Vestal, but these are pretty precious. The SB also breaks guards, can ignore a portion of protections, and does pretty good damage. All in all its a pretty good DLC, I'd recommend waiting for a sale as $4 for something the fantastic modding community could have made is a little overkill.",76561198055278306,0,106,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

Definitely pay-to-win. /sarcasm

But for real, the Shieldbreaker is an odd class to use as all but one of her attacks move her one position forward or backward. For this reason, I generally keep her in the front two ranks, paired with another character who shines in the front two ranks (usually a highwayman or man-at-arms). As the name implies, she's good at bypassing enemy PROT, and has an ability that removes an enemy Guard buff and prevents that enemy from being guarded for a few turns. She can also Blight enemies, de-stealth enemies, and can do an attack that does bonus damage against Marked enemies, making her quite versatile.

Her trinkets are locked behind specific nighttime ambushes that trigger when you have a Shieldbreaker in your party when camping. These cannot be prevented with camping skills, but there are 7 of them in total; after defeating all 7 of them, they will never happen again. After defeating the nighttime ambush, you're awarded with a Shieldbreaker trinket and some other loot.

Overall I think the Shieldbreaker DLC is a fine addition to the game that adds even more depth to party compositions and combat. She works well against enemies weak to Blight and who have PROT (Cove, anyone?), and due to the nature of her moveset and how she moves between ranks, she shrugs at the thought of getting moved or shuffled around in the party by enemies.",76561198046193538,764,252,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

The fact that they didn't feels too much like a cheap cashgrab on ther part trying to nickel and dime their players, which is sad since I (like most DD players I imagine) will gladly pay for their dlcs, because they feel like complete content.

In the end, since the price is not that high, that DLC is probably the kind of thing that would deserve a ""neutral"" rating, but since steam don't allow that, and since Red Hook mysteriously forgot to localize the DLC I'll give it a thumb down, but that could change if it turn out that the Color of Madness is the same price than the Crimson Court minus the price of that  DLC.

But still, RH, just localize that thing, there's really not much text here, and it pretty disrespectful to your players to not do that whent he game itself is already localized.
