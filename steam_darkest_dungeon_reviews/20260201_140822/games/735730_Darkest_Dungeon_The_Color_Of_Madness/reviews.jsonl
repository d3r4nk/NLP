In fact, I adore this DLC for so many reasons. The art direction, the interesting trinkets, the music, the Thing from the Stars, and the Districts added by this are not just nothing to scoff at, they're universally amazing. The art is a perfect homage to the Color out of Space, and takes it in a wonderful direction that is not only unique but utterly gorgeous, and the music is similarly great. As well, the trinkets added by this are almost universally interesting, quirky, and add something to the game that generally wasn't there before. As well, the last part I love is the new roaming boss in The Thing from the Stars, which is a fun and challenging boss (though not very fun for newer players) with cool and varied rewards.\n\nHowever, this DLC has a crippling flaw in the worst place it could possibly have it: the Farmstead. The first few expeditions the Farmstead throws at the player are actually quite good as tutorials and explanations of how the main attraction of the DLC works. However, the problems start once the Endless Harvest becomes an option.\n\nSimply put, the Endless harvest is a fun concept crippled by its balancing and randomness. Darkest Dungeon is a game heavily designed around RNG mitigation with the trinket and quirk systems, so an area where not only does the player have random modifiers (which are VERY significant to gameplay and can either doom you or set you up for an easy win on a whim), often random rewards for surviving each wave, and random enemy compositions just feels bad to me. Far too often I end up feeling like I don't have any control over how my run in the Farmstead goes and can only hold on as tight as my heroes get tossed into god knows what. I understand that's the point of the DLC's themeing, but it creates a huge problem with the actual gameplay that I don't really like.\n\nSpeaking of poor gameplay decisions, the Endless Harvest has an incredibly strict meta team composition of Vestal/Jester/two Shieldbreakers. I already disdain the Shieldbreaker for being incredibly overpowered, but the way that the Farmstead forces this incredibly boring combo on the player as the only meaningful option to get anywhere just sucks. The stress and damage that can only inconsistently be dealt with out of combat means that the Jester and Vestal are a requirement for the area, and the two Shieldbreakers are the only heroes that have the ability to get around all of the generally unfair enemies and abilities the Farmstead often throws at the player. Since options like bleed and blight are too reliant on specific situations, they are completely useless, and most other characters simply can't keep up with the stress or damage requirements the farmstead imposes. This is worsened by the enemy design introduced with this area especially, with many being either outright unfair or incredibly annoying.\n\nEnemies like plow horses being able to stealth themselves while putting themselves in the generally safe rank 3/4 before going for a full party shuffle is just blatantly unfair, the constant use of backline enemies that are far more durable than they should be, and the ridiculous amount of stress the room transitions pile onto the player at all times means that anything outside of the meta is massively handicapped. As well, the rewards from the Farmstead aren't even all that good for acquiring large amounts of shards for the previously mentioned cool trinkets and Districts. Overall, the gameplay is too focused on some really boring strategies, is too rigid, and is not very rewarding at all.\n\nAll in all, The Color of Madness is a beautiful, complex, interesting mess. The issues I have with this DLC are simply too great for me to truly recommend it for most, but if you like the trinkets and concept and are willing to sit through a lot of grinding and some bad mechanics, there certainly is a lot of appeal here. It's good enough for literally being 5 dollars, isn't too impactful on the base game unlike a CERTAIN DLC, nor does it add anything blatantly overpowered like a CERTAIN pair of DLC, nor does it add anything too awful. If it had some serious balance and design changes for things like colors, enemies, DOT viability, and application of rewards, I would wholeheartedly endorse this DLC.", "author_steamid": "76561198380790355", "author_num_games_owned": 165, "author_num_reviews": 16, "author_playtime_forever": 0, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": null, "author_last_played": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00"}

To be brutally honest, I hyper fixated on Darkest Dungeon for a couple months grinding my heart and soul out and I definitely wasn't amused by an endless mode. For me it meant grinding for hours for trinkets that didn't do anything particularly special, to see my town get buildings that didn't actually appear on the screen and just were in a separate tab to show they exist, to see the same background rooms over a new dungeon, buckled in really just for Lvl 5-6 heros realistically, to play for achievements. I did really appreciate that the worst part of the game play, literally just walking fight to fight, was taken out as you just go to fight after fight.\n\nIt's a few extra trinkets, a kind of tossed in story to justify why it's there, and an excuse to push yourself to get a higher and higher number of kills as a personal goal. I mean that literally, because there isn't a leaderboard or anything despite the game using online elements for other DLC(Butcher's Circus). I personally wouldn't get this unless it was on sale, but maybe you like Endless Mode for games more than I do. It's a positive review because I can see it fitting for other people pretty well, just not for me(I might also just be burnt out! Haha).\n\nGeneric tips and tricks for the interested:\n\n-Endless mode seems to treat 'Uses per battle' for abilities weirdly, they didn't refresh for me on a rest. May be a bug, very important for me to write out\n\n-The setup is different from the dungeon and doesn't seem to like a lot of mixing when it comes to the team. Unfortunately, my favorite team ended up being Sheildbreaker(DLC) x2, Jester, Vestal. Leper or Man-At-Arms is good too\n\n-Be careful of the trinkets you bring", "author_steamid": "76561198400890911", "author_num_games_owned": 27, "author_num_reviews": 61, "author_playtime_forever": 0, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": null, "author_last_played": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00"}

While both DLCs are great, one of the main problems I've found with CC is how intrusive it is to the main gameplay. What with all the CC enemies invading other areas, The Crimson Curse, and the roaming boss that keeps me up at night in fear. If you aren't accustomed to the main game, or prepared to switch up your playstyle to accommodate, the Crimson Court DLC will absolutely wipe the floor with you.\n\nHowever, the Color of Madness DLC (CoM) is relatively non-intrusive, and it compliments the main game especially well. Again, I'd like to reiterate that I don't think that CC is a necessarily bad DLC, but the way CoM flows into the main game simply fits. The additions it adds only compliment the main gameplay, instead of changing it altogether. To give an example, a few new quirks have been added in this DLC. A lot of these quirks fall in line with a majority of the quirks in the game, such as the CoM-introduced quirks Hot to Trot, Natural, or Daredevil. These quirks act about how you'd expect them to, but along with these quirks are the Prismatic quirks. These quirks are automatically reinforced on the heroes they appear on, and cannot be swapped out by other quirks outside of removing them via the Sanitarium. Additionally, these quirks can only occur on one person per roster. These new quirks switch up the ways you would handle typical quirk management, proposing new questions and problems for attaining these quirks on your heroes. These quirks are powerful, but the problems lie in finding where they would work best in your party, as there can only be one person with that quirk in your entire roster. However, you're never [i]forced[/i] to handle these quirks and minmax them to the highest degree, and they don't require a total playstyle shift as something like the Crimson Curse would. It's a neat addition to the game that compliments the base Darkest Dungeon experience by building on what you've learned, instead of adding a completely new mechanic altogether.\n\nI feel as though a lot of the additions introduced in the CoM DLC follow this philosophy of building upon mechanics instead of introducing entirely new ones. The new ideas it brings up add a new flavor of play to the game, although it's not as wildly unique as the additions in CC. While I adore the two DLCs to death, CoM will always rest as my favorite due to how it went about introducing its ideas and additions. It's a fantastic DLC that spices up the Darkest Dungeon experience without out and out changing it. If you're trying to choose between whether to pick up Crimson Court or Color of Madness first, I'd recommend Color of Madness every time.", "author_steamid": "76561198067449493", "author_num_games_owned": 0, "author_num_reviews": 36, "author_playtime_forever": 0, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": null, "author_last_played": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00"}

The problem is that because the Farmstead is a [b]completely[/b] different style of game than the rest of DD and there is [i]no[/i] in-game indication of how you should prepare, I basically just avoided doing any of the missions at all until recently.  Only to find out that the limited use per battle skills inexplicably weren't refreshing--was my game broken? The \"single battle\" buffs only lasted a single wave, but the \"single battle\" uses weren't coming back!\n\nYeah, no. Redhook decided to go with the lazy \"git gud\"mentality and because too many people were having fun making groups that dominated the early waves, the devs decided that the right way to address that was to arbitrarily change the meaning of \"single battle\" to mean whatever they liked best without giving the players an in-game way to know that. Not only is that really bad UX design, but it also limited the viable team comps for the Farmstead even [i]more[/i] than they were before! \n\nThey had already added a mechanic to later levels to give more of a difficulty curve, so why not add a debuff to certain skills that made them limited use for the entire level? That way you 1) keep the consistency of what \"one battle\" means; 2) don't punish new players and lower level players; and 3) still give the higher level players a good challenge. But I guess anything that could possibly be fun or good game design would interfere with the \"git gud\" mentality.\n\nIf you want a good balance between punishing mechanics and fun content, stick with the base game and Crimson Court DLC.

The translation was, alegedly, awful, so this caused a lot of negative reivews. The patch was great but it fixed a long-standing exploit and people who were abusing it also review-bombed the game. So when looking up reviews for The Color of Madness you're very likely to run into negative reviews of it which don't actually have anything to do with it.\n\nIt's a great shame, because the expansion is excellent. The graphics and the sound are beautiful as usual, and they explore an area of Lovecraft's work not yet properly delved into in the base game. Darkest Dungeon never needed any praising on the art front, as even harshest critics have to take their hat off before the artists in Red Hook.\n\nMechanically, the DLC introduces great things. Someone knowledgeable could, and absolutely should, grumble about how a lot of what it introduced could have and should have been part of the core game in one way or another from early beta, but it's here now. So what do you get by purchasing this lovely little thing?\n\n- A new area, the Farmstead, where you get to fight a series of long battles against waves of monsters, new bossess and many old ones. This is very fun post-game content for after you've played through the core game and Crimison Court. Don't ask me why the core game didn't have it's own rooms with longer fights, or why bossess dissapeared from it once you beat them several times. I didn't make it. But I sure suggested both those things, and this DLC finally brought them into the game.\n\n- Cool new monsters which only appear in the new area. They're not terribly dangerous but play together well and do interesting and cool things. Red Hook have come a long way in designing monster encounters, and it shows. Or they found folks who're rather good at it. Why do these fun opponents only show up in the Farmstead, again, don't ask me. I neither made the game, nor raised the folks who did.\n\n- A new wondering boss you can fight for special loot. In the best implementation of the concept yet, the new wondering boss will anounce itself before you pick a dungeon run, so you can either try to go chase after it, or avoid it as you see fit. It's an excellent fight and breathes a bit of life into the old core dungeons.\n\n- Two brand new bossess exclusive to the Farmstead, as well as an opportunity to fight old ones. Well, it's more like three new bossess in the Farmstead, because one changes its form mid-fight. Great stuff!\n\n- A whole slew of new trinkets, and they're more interesting than the old ones. The special currency used to buy them can also turn into a new kind of consumable item. I have always been dissapointed with a lot of design choices about the items, or trinkets as they are called, in DD as they explored a small part of the potential design space. Some of the CoM trinkets are among the most interesting and fun designs ever seen in the game. Ok, that's not saying much, but they're interesing enough they'd be right at home in a game with more interesting items in general.\n\n- The Farmstead also features rooms with effects - that is, for the first time ever the room you have a fight in adds bonuses, maluses and special conditions to the fight. Again, try explaining to someone who hasn't purchased DD that every single room in it doesn't do this already and they'll have a hard time grasping why, but if you do get CoM at least you'll have one dungeon where (some) rooms are meaningful. I'm overjoyed to finally be able to experience this, even if the implementation, as usual, only covered a small % of interesting room effects. \"A bit of something\" is still a lot better than \"none of something\", expecially if it's something that's sorely lacking from the game.\n\n- Four new Town buildings (districts) with several effect that have been asked for again and again by the community. I won't spoil the details.\n\n- New uniqe and powerful quirks for your characters, and you don't even have to invest any in-game currency into \"locking\" them in place on your crew. Long time players will know just how great that is.\n\nAnd while I might be forgetting something, this should be enough for you to know that this is a no-brainer purchase both if you do like Darkest Dungeon or if you've been dissapointed with it's relative sparseness and lack of content. The only real complaints about CoM would be - why wasn't most of this stuff part of the game already, and why did a lot of it get cordoned off into one area instead of applied to many other parts of the rather sparse core game?\n\nBut that's all the more reason to get CoM if you mean to play DD. It makes it a better, more interesting game. Absolute thumbs up!\n\nEDIT: And I forgot to mention a very important thing which will interest long time players. Your characters can't die \"for real\" on a Farmstead run, and Farmstead runs don't advance the week. This gives your \"overleveled\" characters something useful and interesting to do while you develop your Hamlet. It can get you cool loot and trinkets, and several somewhat sucesful runs will give you enough \"shards\" to purchase a useful town district or interesting and powerful crystalline trinkets for your regular runs. You might hear talk that this DLC is only post-game content, but that's not true - it makes starting from scratch a lot more interesting and less frustrating than ever before.", "author_steamid": "76561198021087888", "author_num_games_owned": 246, "author_num_reviews": 174, "author_playtime_forever": 0, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": null, "author_last_played": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00"}

That being said, I will make this expansion review as non-biased as possible to entice players to give this DLC a try, because it is absolutely worth playing.\n\nDisclosure: I received this product for free due to my participation in Red Hook's Beta Testing Stage.\n\nVisuals/Sound Design:\n-The DLC includes many new lighting enhancements, backgrounds, and enemies to the game, giving insight into the truly unique mood of the color of madness. The comet striking the farmstead, and the events that unfold the further you play are incredibly new and haunting to those who play. In this regard, the way this expansion looks is unlike anything you would ever see in the core game or the crimson court. \n\n-Likewise, Red Hook has added a plethora of new music to the farmstead, which are truly reminiscent of eldritch and otherworldly themes. New monologues are added by Wayne, so there are new instances of flavor to your play experience as well. \n\nCore Gameplay:\n-Included here is a set of new bosses and standard enemies, with their own art, skill sets, and dark-souls-esque lore. Each of which are uniquely difficult and fun for every party composition. One particular fight is one that relies on not a battle of victory, but a battle of attrition and survival, a new concept that is well-made in this format.\n\n-New area for missions. There are three mission types newly added to the farmstead: the short, apprentice level, wave-based mission that introduces players to the setting, gamestyle, and enemies. The second is the same, but adds a boss at the end for the more experienced players looking for better turnouts. \n\n-The last is the advertised endless mode, which is by far the best mission type included, which merits its own hyphen. This puts your party composition against a literal endless amount of enemies to fight. Now, despite this \"endless\" stigma tacked on to a hardcore turn-based game that adds permadeath, this game mode is exempt from that particular rule. As I threathen to spoil details, I will leave it at that. Likewise, there are many many suprises that will make the endless experience fun and rewarding. It should be fun and rewarding, you will most likely be spending a large amount of time on this mode, so you should be engrossed and rewarded for your time, which this mode definitely does. \n\n-The new shard currency system was also added, which can be used to buy incredibly useful trinkets at the trinket vendor, as well as new buildings, which are fairly lackluster to say the least except for two, and create a new shard dust provision to give you a very big edge in battle. You can collect these shards during farmstead missions, and the collection process is, in truth, a grind. There are many many trinkets and buildings, which are expensive to say the least, and after each *average* endless run in the farmstead, you may only afford one of them. So yes, it will be very difficult to collect them all.\n\nIn conclusion, if you are looking for a fresh new take on the formula Red Hook has given you, then you will absolutely love The Color of Madness. There is enough content here to give you hundreds of more hours of gameplay. When I personally look at pricetags, I think of the minds of the developers and their reasoning as to why they priced it that way. At $5.00, one would expect $5.00 of content, which to a lot of you doesn't seem like much content.

The key distinguishing feature of this presence is a unearthly glow of a color undefinable to the human experience. \n\nThe Color of Madness chooses to render this color as a pale shade somewhere between teal and turquoise, the only color that escapes the Blasted Heath outside the Hamlet. Once, a kindly Miller and his wife lived there. Desperate from two years of failed crop yields, the Miller came to the Ancestor and begged him to save his farm. The Ancestor agreed to help, but in his typical cruel and self-serving fashion, brought the Miller and his farmhands only ruin- this time, not from the corruption seeping from beneath the manor house, but from somewhere else entirely. Now, the Farmstead's inhabitants have been corrupted by a spreading crystalline infestation, draining all color and life from them and transforming them into violent, crumbling husks- even the formerly inanimate scarecrows. \n\nA seed of interstellar hatred now grows in the Blasted Heath, horrifically warping time and space around it, and you can send your heroes on a series of quests into the new Farmstead region to investigate. After a small, fixed, introductory quest and a slightly longer one to face the Farmstead's first boss, you unlock the meat of this DLC: An endless dungeon where you face not only the Farmstead's creepy new enemies, the Husks, but also enter strangely-lit pocket dimensions which feature enemies and bosses from all of the other regions. The Farmstead has no layout per se, just fights, and more fights, and a progress bar that shows how close you are to your goal- or at least to the next boss fight. You will always fight the two Farmstead-specific bosses first. Like the Courtyard's special \"Bloodlight\" condition, the Farmstead features a variety of unique lighting effects that render Torch items useless, and carry with them certain buffs and debuffs for both your party and your enemies. Pass 200 kills in endless and a negative mutator will also be applied to your party, compounding the long haul further. There is also a new wandering boss that can also appear in the vanilla dungeon areas, and it is dangerous enough that the game will actually tell you where it is each week. It is by far the ugliest thing you will see in this game, and it is known only as... The Thing From The Stars. \n\nCrystal shards can be found in the Farmstead that can be traded with a new merchant at the trinket vendor, for new trinkets, some general, but mostly character specific ones. You can also use these and one other new resource, Memories, to construct some new districts- including rebuilding the Mill, which removes random hunger checks from your quests.", "author_steamid": "76561197970739339", "author_num_games_owned": 775, "author_num_reviews": 607, "author_playtime_forever": 0, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": null, "author_last_played": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00"}

Color of Madness is the third DLC to the game and it has its own mini-story to go with it, mostly taking place on a Farmstead where a comet from outer space has landed, bringing with it some eldritch horrors. This is what's contained in the DLC:\n\n- 3 missions in a whole new area: the introductory Apprentice level mission, a longer Veteran level mission with a boss, and then the Endless Harvest mission (Darkest difficulty) that's technically endless, as the name suggests, but it's not just mindless wave after wave of enemies. It has some structure to it, where you'd battle new enemies for a couple of waves, then some enemies from one of the 4 maingame dungeons, and then it's usually a boss, and the further you go, the boss changes, although once you defeated the final boss of this DLC, the mission still continues and you can keep doing the whole thing anew if you so wish. The Endless Harvest mission doesn't get depleted and you can keep returning to it as many times as you want. All 3 of the missions behave more like making a stand in one area against incoming foes rather than traversing through dungeons.\n\n- About half a dozen of new enemies to go to the theme of the new area, things such as possessed farm workers, possessed scarecrows, possessed horses, and so on. They all have their own unique behaviours, so you'll need to employ some new tactics.\n\n- 4 new bosses (if I counted it correctly). One of these bosses is a wandering boss that randomly spawns in one of the 4 main areas of the game rather than in the DLC area. I've yet to find the wandering boss, but from among the others, I've found the two non-final bosses to have some interesting strategies under their sleeve, but the final boss is a bit too straightforward and mostly just spams powerful AoE attacks on the whole group rather than having new and interesting attacks.\n\n- A new currency - Comet Shards. You only get these from the new area and they're required for purchasing special trinkets and constructing the new district buildings (see below).\n\n- A good bunch of new trinkets that can only be bought with comet shards. Each hero class has a unique one for itself, and there are also some that can be equipped to anyone.\n\n- A few new district buildings. These mostly just provide one additional effect to your supplies that you take to the missions (e.g. antivenom doesn't only cure blight but can now provide some resistance to it if used pre-emptively).\n\n- A handful of really stunning music tracks that play in the battles of this new area. In my opinion, these new music tracks are some of the best the game has had so far. Do yourself a favour and give them a listen.\n\n- Some new quirks have been added, including some quirks that are one-of-a-kind, which can only be gotten by one hero on a roster at a time and no more (these are usually very good quirks). \n\nIn my opinion, this is a really nice DLC and well-worth getting for its small price tag, so long as you enjoyed the base game. I think it's a little less complicated and less punishing than the Crimson Court. Whereas Crimson Court added a lot of complexity and new mechanics to deal with, Color of Madness is mostly just enjoying yourself in constant combat without worrying about micromanaging additional mechanics. In that sense, if you didn't like Crimson Court due to the new mechanics it added, then you might still like Color of Madness.", "author_steamid": "76561197989390503", "author_num_games_owned": 675, "author_num_reviews": 211, "author_playtime_forever": 0, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": null, "author_last_played": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00"}

This DLC also contains some minor amount of lore, mainly showing how much of a grade A bastard your Ancestor was [spoiler](\"My only regret is that I did not live to see that shoddy mill smashed to pieces by the miraculous bounty I reaped from beyond the void.\").[/spoiler]\n\nTo access it you first you first have to beat 2 missions that serve as a sort of \"Introduction\" to the infinite mission you'll be able to play. They are... ok. Mostly just showing you the hopes while also throwing some challenges at you. When you're done with them you get to the real cheese of this DLC: The Infinite Mode!! Where you're thrown against infinite (huh) hordes of enemies and bosses in search of the new currency of this DLC: Comet Shards (along with a harder to get currency: Memories). Get ready to throw your hardened traumatized veterans into the impossible blue cracked fields of a cursed farm in search of those! It'll almost be totally worth it!\n\nSeriously now, the Comet Shards allow you to buy new special DLC trinkets in a new section of the Nomad Wagon (some of which possess never seen before properties), build special districts and they can even be used as a dust in battle to make your Heroes stronger for some time. Beware, though, for the dust has different reactions if a hero keep using it and it also debuffs your Hero in some way. I don't really use them as I'd rather use the shards for other stuff but I can see them being useful. Also, a problem that I had with the districts is simply how long one of them takes to be built. This one building takes 10 very hard to get \"Memories\" (the second new currency in the DLC) to be made... Requiring many hours of grind. Rivalling even The Great Crimson Court's Trinket Hunt™.\n\nThe Infinite Mission is the main attraction in this DLC and it delivers... although not in the way I expected it to. There's not much to be said about the whole \"infinite\" part of it. You're fighting old and new enemies and bosses... infinitely (of course it's not infinitely, you can stop at any point and just escape with your accumulated rewards). Sometimes the Farmstead's Lighting will change and effects will be applied both to Heroes as well as enemies, and after a while enemies will get stronger. Due to the way the Farmstead works (and the whole \"constant battles\" thing), if you want to get far without problems you won't have many team compositions available to you. Heroes with great versatility are the best ones that you can use here. Heroes with poor versatility or that can't target many different enemy spots will make you suffer, which is a shame, considering the DLC adds so many interesting trinkets that can barely be used thanks to this.\n\nThe music tracks are, again, amazing. Stuart continues to make a great job. My fave is Blasted Heath. It goes well with the whole \"a terrible thing fell on these lands\" theme and the infinite horde of half-crystalized enemies marching towards you. If I had to complain about something is that they can be considered as \"repetitive\" in a way, but this isn't a problem inherent to the music, [b]it comes from the DLC.[/b]\n\nI consider the art in this DLC the epitome of Darkest Dungeon. The colors on the Farmstead changing with meaning, the hauntingly beautiful glimmer of the shards and the stress symbol mixed with it, the \"impossible\" backgrounds when lost between space and time... I simply [b]LOVED[/b] it.\n\nWhile this DLC can feel repetitive and boring in some aspects, I really enjoyed it. Testing my Heroes against the unstoppable horde of Husks and trying to see how far I could go before everything fell apart was a fun deed. Getting my crystals and buying unfathomable trinkets for my Heroes along with building neat new districts was nice. More goals for the endless quest.\n\nGood DLC!\n\n[spoiler]\"The poor Miller — [b]thrice a victim[/b].

Just a little bit, yet enough to force player to take a new look at the task on hand. It has to be stated that Color of Madness has flatout less content than Crimson Court, but its price is lowered properly to match. With this in mind what new horrors loom in the darkness?\n\n[b] The Harvest awaits [/b]\nColor of Madness introduces new area – the Farmstead with complete set of new enemies and environment specific curios and items. DLC introduces husks – remains of Miller and his unfortunate workers stuck beyond space and time, warped beyond recognition. DLC also introduces 3 new bosses: the aforementioned Miller, the Thing from Stars – eldritch horror from outer space, and the Sleeper – cosmic malignance that awaits the player in the endless mode.\n\nWhy yes. Color of Madness in essence simply adds endless mode into the game. This is only type of mission that can be undertaken in farmstead. Entirety of gameplay revolves around fighting wave upon wave of enemies as each kill painfully slowly fills the reward bar. After reaching certain amount there will be a moment of respite and hopefully a curio to heal body or mind (luckily there are no harmful ones), once bar is filled first tier of rewards is guaranteed. Then you can try to reach next tier again and then again, however long your party can last. While base game is all about survival this DLC is plain war of attrition where you are the only side affected by it.\n\n[b] The little things [/b]\nContrary to the Crimson Court, Color of Madness has almost no impact on game world beside the Thing from the Stars roaming the land. Each week it is shown where you will have a chance to face the Thing, allowing you to avoid it at your leisure if you choose to do so. Beside that it is almost exclusively quality of life additions. Stage coach and nomad wagon gain a crystalline twist. There come mercenaries who are always level 6 maxed out heroes, providing you with endless supply of quality cannon fodder. As everything in the game they come at a price - they can be used only in Farmstead and will tax you a fraction of shards you managed to gather. Nomad wagon on the other hand gets a crystal hungry counterpart that will provide unique crystalline trinkets that will greatly aid your ventures into the Farmstead. New DLC is grind turned up to eleven but wagon trinkets create progression system of sorts – the more you do, the better trinkets you get so you can harvest even more.\n\nArtwise Farmstead is as lovely as any other part of the game if new art is somewhat less numerous since you don’t really get to walk anywhere, rather stand and fight while reality bends around you. It has to be noted that while Lovecraftian themes where ever-present in the game, for the first time Red Hook were this direct with drawing inspiration. DLC is literally named after short H.P. Lovecraft story.\n\nNew DLC is, if modest, simply a fine addition. If you enjoy Darkest Dungeon’s combat you get a place to truly let loose. As color of madness change you can meet enemies from all regions and later even any hard-tier boss. There is a twist though, you must build your party to last. Sheer lethality and full backpack of supplies won’t do when minds of your party snap like twigs. In the long run it is often stress that is the real killer here.", "author_steamid": "76561198010155821", "author_num_games_owned": 888, "author_num_reviews": 124, "author_playtime_forever": 0, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": null, "author_last_played": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00"}

Then, as has been a trend, Red Hook seemed to jump at attention when people started to compain the usual \"It's TOO EASY!\".  Those people complaining, as usual, seemingly mostly being twinks who have played upwards of hundreds of hours, jumping into the DLC content with estates in the hundreds of weeks, with their twinked out parties of min-maxed heroes and trinket combos. \n\nThe sad part being, I impulse bought this almost IMMEDIATELY after watching several streamers give it a try, and watching them sing the praises of how fun and well balanced they thought the new content was, especially after how much of an absolute slog the Crimson Court content could be.  Fun?  In the Darkest Dungeon again?  Sign me up, right?  Shame that it seems to be getting gnawed away at by the usual \"git gud\" crowd.  You people know who you are.  Go ahead and downvote this, noone cares what you think anymore.\n\nThat aside, let's go into the meat of the content of the DLC itself; you can expect, if you are starting from a fresh file:\n#1)  One (1) \"apprentice\" level dungeon, that introduces the Farmstead and some of the new creatures, in a \"mini-run\" of sorts.\n#2)  One (1) \"veteran\" level dungeon, that introduces the format of the meat of the DLC, the Endless Mode, but in a sample sized, 3-\"wave\" portion that culminates in one of the major new bosses of the area.  It is a very, VERY well executed introduction to how things will be working, the \"shifting colors\" torch-light mechanic, the \"mid-wave break and resupply\", and how progress and rewards are done.\n#3)  An endless amount of the Endless Harvest mode, a \"Darkest Difficulty\" dungeon which essentially takes #2, and makes THE MEATGRINDER go on until you click the \"retreat\" button, at which point (at the time of writing this) you are given an absolutely free pass out of the current dungeon run, even during combat, with no chance to fail like usual retreats.  A randomized boss is selected from a small pool every few waves to try to prevent you from reaching the next tier of rewards, mostly being the \"shards\" that are traded in town for new buildings or (mostly gimmicky) trinkets.\n#4)  An endless amount of a new \"wandering boss\" that has a chance to show up on one of the major 4 properties during any week.  Rewards are possibly unique trinkets, unique quirks, and even more shards to trade.  He's a good boss, with a couple of neat gimmicks, and even if you run into him in an apprentice dungeon, a solid party with a plan should be able to take him down.\n\nAll in all, it's a solid amount of content...except at the same time, please note up there that this means only one apprentice and one veteran outing into the new area is given to you, then it's \"almost all endgame party all the time\".  That's right, it's even more Champion-centric than Crimson Court was.  To alleviate (?) this, they do give you the option of hiring up to 6 Champion-grade \"mercenaries\" at a time...except they're all the same as the kind of \"fresh off the wagon\" hires you would get, AND they take some of your earned shards from you per-mercenary-per-run on top of it.  So while you can TECHNICALLY still \"enjoy\" The Farmstead while you're still in the lower levels of a newer game file, it'll be with parties of generics.  (If this was to keep people away from getting the new trinkets early, it's a funny way of doing so, since most of the new ones are gimmicky or even generally outclassed by what you would get late-game, or from Crimson Court.)\n\nThe art and music are great, as usual, and as stated above, the CORE CONCEPT of the DLC is a solid one.  But in the end, it comes down to this being a DLC that is mostly there for people already at endgame to challenge themselves.  Conventially, if you are at a point where you're able to enter the Endless Harvest over and over again, to win enough to trade for all the new goods available, you're proabably already ready to head into the Darkest Dungeon and just beat the game.  The only reason you would have for doing it at that point is wanting the endgame to go on forever.  And if that's what you're into, great!  This is for you.  If you're looking for something to supplement/run parallel to a \"from scratch\" playthrough...not so much.  \nOh, and not so much if you don't enjoy, as of writing this, the addition of such things as just plain empty \"middle finger\" rewards rooms.  Or the Crimson Court Croc.  Yes, that.  We all laughed, and made jokes about \"at least the Croc isn't in this one\".

I really enjoy it - the different style of gameplay is fun, the trinkets are kinda neat, new roaming boss is quite the fight.  But it's not a \"new storyline, lots of new content\" sort of DLC.  I personally like Crimson Court trinkets way more, and play the Farmstead only when I'm in the mood for an \"Endless Quest\" type of run.\n\nThere is one very notable perk though (which I hope they don't nerf away because it's a big reason I still play the Endless Harvest): one you complete the \"storyline\" of Color of Madness and get to the endless portion, there's no death.  Your heroes can still \"die\" in the quest, but instead of actually dying they just disappear for a week and come back massively stressed out.  (You will lose equipped trinkets though, so watch out.)  This is nice because I feel like i can test the limits of my heroes, weird party combos, etc. without worrying about losing my Level 6 folks.

It will only make the already difficult learning curve even more challenging and most likely cause you to wipe your runs and have to start over.\n\nIf you are a veteran and love the combat than this is the dlc for you. It's all about trying to get as far as you can in endless battles, and the nerfs that have hit just about everybody will make you rethink a lot of your tried and true strategies. They call them balance changes but if you look at the patch notes its alomst all nerfs except giving everybody (except houndmaster, apprently he needed negative crit chance) 1-2% crit chance and a buff when they do crit. So far it has made most of the characters feel weaker but maybe I just haven't adapted yet. It's pretty annoying though when you try to do something you could before and can't, like hit somebody in rank 3 with rampart, and then you have to change your whole strategy on the fly but I'm sure I'll learn.\n\nThe new enemy types are fun and really bring back the sense of danger running into a new enemy type brought before you knew what they all did. However I must say I prefer the exeprience of running dungeons to this new mode. I love the balancing act of when to use what items, what route to take, etc. A lot of the strategy is lost here as it's just load up on as many supplies as you can get your hands on to try to last as long as possible with no incenitve to leave space for other things.\n\nThe new vendor and buldings are neat but nothing amazing. Not really a lot to say about them.\n\nOverall it's great to get more Darkest Dungeon.

You can also do this to farm Shrieker's exclusive quirks.\n\nYou can test out various strats using Farmstead-exclusive level 6 heroes that will become available from the Stage Coach. They will steal some of your shards though.\n\nSome of the trinkets are generally great, but most of them aren't all that, many are tailored for the endless mode so have a look at them while devising your strategy.\n\nAlso adds a wandering boss that drops a few exclusive trinkets, you can see where he might be lurking on the overworld map.

The whole idea of \"enemies become stronger\" present in nearly all games with endless modes isn't really here:\n- Enemies stay at the same level and don't get any progressive increase in stats via torch modifiers and whatnot. \n- You just get a predermined penalty after 200 kills which you can see on the map and therefore decide if you want to go or wait for the other one.\n- Those first 2 bosses are actually the ones that will determine whether you can keep going. If you handle them (returning to AoE dodge or healing mentioned above) then you can, and nearly forever, regardless of reflections and such, until you get an unlucky deathblow or just can't stomach doing the same thing anymore. \nThe infamous \"battle limited skills\" patch was a prime example of balancing the normal game around DLCs and failing to do so, and additionally ruining the experience of the DLC even further. Shard dust isn't used in endless, it's used to cheese bosses with 7 stacks of Bolster/Revenge/Plague Doc vapours and it's undoubtedly more broken than activating Revenge in every wave in endless. I don't really understand why the subject of 1000 kills was such a touchy matter that the devs had to push the Vestal/Antiquarian/Jester meta even further! Since the endless waves are long battles, stacking battle-long buffs or charging Finale finally saw a new use, but devs said \"no, keep them only for bosses, AGAIN, or just take a Shieldbreaker with that OP crystal trinket.\" Heroes like Leper or Abomination were never crit-heavy or simply popular due to loads of restrictions and disadvantages they have (and I say it as a Leper player) but they still had to get nerfed overall just because of endless kill scores. And yet they decided not to do anything to Man-at-Arms who can do everything especially with his new busted Bolster and -33% stress from crit that procs from riposte too and stacks twice. Or with Shieldbreaker who can attack anything from anywhere with high base damage, crit and natural armor break. Priorities... \nAmong other things: filters in the waves (especially red) are also terrible and eat your eyes away, probably intentionally trying to get you afflicted in real life.

It seems that the only way you're meant to understand the Farmstead is by sending a squad or two to their death or, alternatively, scour the wiki for what happens before you enter. 1st encounter had no resting so I assumed it was safe to avoid food, the 2nd visit left me at a required rest without warning.

Not because you played poorly, but because you didn't bring enough food or anti-venom. The DLC offers very little in terms of interesting additions and insular design that makes it feel entirely worth avoiding. There's little compositional variety and the infinite mode gets old super quick while providing zero content outside of itself. \n\nOn the other hand the artists have, as always, done amazing work and provided some beautiful new enemies.

The DLC makes a lot of changes, and almost all of them make the game more difficult and overall make it less fun.  Enemies now CRIT with an absurd frequency, now enemies that have 1 damage stress attacks are doing crits, which Ive never seen before this update.\n\nEnemies also now bully and single out a specific character, typically the healer. Never had this experience on Radiant (easiest) difficulty before, but now its absurd. Battles quickly shift into stressfull bouts of desperately trying to keep the healer alive while your party continually misses every attack. Accuracy/dodge/miss system has been changed too, again favoring irrational difficulty. Any of my party members that dont have at least 100 accuracy miss half of their attacks, even against enemies with 0 dodge.\n\nNew quirks have been added, and lo and behold they make the game even more infuriating. Recruits now have 2-3 negative quirks upon recruitment, and one good perk. It used to be an even 1 good 1 bad split. The RNG for hero creation is also broken, as currently 9 out of 11 of my roster have the negative quirk light sensitive, this is unprecedented, Ive never seen a perk occur with such frequency, another indication of broken RNG.\n\nThe good quirks they added range from lackluster to downright worthless, the only one Ive seen so far in my game that was worthwhile was one that gave 25% stress healed, which is still pretty dissapointing. But the bad quirks have been intensified to an asinine degree. Remember slow reflexes, the -1 speed perk? Bad enough on its own, but theres a new one called \"fading\" that DOUBLES the speed debuff to -2 and also throws in -5 dodge. \n\nThats the equivilent of THREE negative perks all wrapped up in one, two slow reflexes and one clumsy perk. Awesome! Considering recruits now start with 3 bad quirks, youll be spending most of your gold stuffing the sanitarium full trying to get your squad to not suck so damn much, enjoy.\n\nThe RNG has been completely botched. Enemies that normally had an extremely rare crit chance now proc crits ten times more often, which doesnt sound like a \"minor change\" to me, its a total overahaul. The \"critsmas\" crit mechanic they added does NOT work as advertised, or even as they intended, youve been warned. Heroes miss way more attacks than they should, and the most damning piece of evidence is that I surprise enemy groups on EVERY single battle, a small mercy. Normally surprising mobs would happen only semi-often under certain circumstances, but now it happens every single time, regardless of my torch light level, trinkets or heroes in party. I tested it with 0 torch light, and the two battles I encountered, both times enemies were surprised.\n\nTo me that indicates just how much the RNG has been botched. The update/DLC has changed things well beyond their intended effects, Im not sure if the devs are even aware of it or understand how/why its happened that way. \n\nThis purchase has been the biggest rip-off Ive ever had the misfortune of spending money on. Not because its money wasted, its only $5, but because its ruined one of my favorite games. Darkest Dungeon just a week ago was a difficult but manageable game that was never short of challenging encounters. Its been twisted into a sadistic and punishing game that will make you  want to rip your hair out. The game always had tempermental RNG, but now its downright broken and completely sporadic, following no set heuristics or logic.\n\nAVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE", "author_steamid": "76561198348029265", "author_num_games_owned": 0, "author_num_reviews": 26, "author_playtime_forever": 0, "author_playtime_last_two_weeks": 0, "author_playtime_at_review": null, "author_last_played": "1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00"}
