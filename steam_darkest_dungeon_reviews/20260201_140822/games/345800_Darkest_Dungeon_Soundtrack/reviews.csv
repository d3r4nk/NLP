You make your way into the depths, knowing something looms ahead.

ITS A TRAP! the spikes flay your tanks foot, it was a close call. Had he run full steam ahead, it likely would have been his last delve into the depths.
You continue forward, cautiously. You hear somehing ahead, your heart begins to beat. Should you light another torch, and possibly give away your position? If you leave it dark, you could step on a trap..... Decisions... you continue forward. You surprise your enemy!

You send your tank in to stun their tank, STUNNED! Your hear races. You have your rogue fire into the line of enemies! 5,4,4 damage! Great! your healer heals the tanks foot, CRIT! Fully healed! Your witch doctor hexes your enemies!
Round went great right? Your enemies begin to attack! your tank takes the brunt of it, CRIT, CRIT, CRIT, CRIT. 
This will be his last delve into the depths, he will no longer be going to the whore house to get some RnR
The whores will surely go hungry tonight.

You continue to push through the battle, What choice is there?
one by one, your party falls, its a clean wipe.... you rolled the dice, and failed.
back in town you attempt to recruit new champions, unfortunately no tank want to take you into the depths.


Re-roll, start over. this run will be better!
The dice are in your hand once again. (maybe this time will be better......)

The songs are meticulously crafted with subtleties that are hard to describe, mixing traditional sounding instruments with synthetic other worldly sounds. The tracks aren't just lazily taken from the game and given a price tag. They are arranged to be a complete album and not just mindless loops with an eventual fade. A good example is ""Explore the Ruins"" which recreates the dynamic effect of the torch system, progressively scaling up in tension. I have many game soundtracks on my DAP, but this is one of the few that feels like a proper album. I am not ashamed to admit that this is one I play a lot while driving in the rain.

I wouldn't have such an issue if this were only £1, but this is SEVEN POUNDS, I pay that much for far higher-end music albums that last a good 70 minutes!

Also, compare this to say, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth OST, it's £2 for 106 minutes, EVEN if you take off however many songs that are just extras you might want to skip, and cut it down to 70 minutes, that's STILL cheaper than any off-the-shelf modern CD album you might reasonably get for the same content.

Don't waste your money on this, go buy the soundtrack of another couple of games you like or go buy a full CD album for this much money, hell you could probably spend this much money on any number of fully fledged games that won't only last 30 minutes and leave you feeling empty.
