You can dance around the other DLC(Color of Madness) if you're stubborn and Butcher's Circus is completely optional. This is not. This is a 'I beat the game and want to do something new!' not a 'this will integrate well with my experience once I start getting level whatever heroes consistently and master some mechanics'. I will show up at your home on my hands and knees begging you to not enable this DLC until you are endgame or near it. Monsters from this DLC can appear in other dungeons and while it's not guaranteed the Crimson Curse is pretty easily transmissible, and it's effect are very hard to deal with when your roster starts getting more and more infected with limited supplies to deal with it. Frankly it's really easy for Crimson Court to overwhelm your game, even softlock you.

I started it on a file where I had already beaten the game and I actually found it really engaging. A infectious disease DOES spread like wildfire, it DOES make sense close quarters might spread it, disease spreading rampantly and dominating my town DOES make sense to me, you DO need to mitigate or treat a disease and it's more negatives than positives(unless you're metagaming and optimizing). I though it was very cool. I thought the enemies were very cool. If I was unfortunate enough to play it early-mid game I can see it completely ruining things for me. The repetition is also an issue and I personally really hate an invitation mechanic. It forces you to grind even longer for a chance at progressing the plot. I would get this on sale exclusively AFTER you've beaten the game or are at the endgame.

Generic tips and tricks for the interested:

-Please don't do it man, take the left mouse button off your finger on the DLC enable screen man, it's not worth it yet. Beat the game or get to endgame first

-Be prepared for the Crimson Curse to dominate your roster eventually. I kept a dedicated team to rotate in and out with strict placement to avoid the spread, flat out fleeing combat with anything that might infect others

-The Flagellant is a very interesting and cool new character to have on your team. I think his presence alone made the DLC much more engaging

-There are certain trinkets that are borderline mandatory to defeat the last boss, and there is not a guarantee you will get all of them before having the opportunity to fight. Be aware there is an optimal way to do it",76561198400890911,27,61,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

On one hand, it introduces a new region with cool map mechanics, a new hero, and a ton of interesting monsters. On the other hand, this expansion does the cardinal sin of mixing DLC content with base game content.

If i had to guess, the disconnect between those who like it and those who do not might largely comes from 2 elements: 1. The Fanatic and Investation feel cheap to the new player with how hard it can be to avoid infection and not take infected party members with you on quests at times and 2. Crimson Court's content warping the game around it rather than enhancing the base game.

My thoughts are as follows:
1. Yes, the Fanatic absolutely is cheap and frankly, I don't like his inclusion in his current state. He is my major problem with  this DLC because unlike other RNG mechanics like The Things From The Stars or Bloodsucker encounters, he feels nearly impossible to be prepared for at all times. Crimson Curse can spread so fast due to infestation that it is not an uncommon occurrence that an average skill player will *have* to take infected party members with them for a decent composition. However, having a decent composition that is *also* good at staying healthy AND fighting off the Fanatic is a big ask for something that is completely up to chance. Compare this to The Thing From The Stars, who is also a random encounter but is shown to roam one specific area on the map at a time. This means that if your current available party members are not good at fighting him, you can simply avoid that area for the time being. The Fanatic is ALWAYS there, can show up at any point during most quests so long as one VERY common condition is met, and he is extremely dangerous. It's not very fun, especially for players new to the DLC.

2. I feel the rest is a general disconnect between a decent part of the playerbase and what I believe Red Hook was trying to accomplish with the DLC. I think *because* it is paid DLC many people might come into Crimson Court with the expectation that since they had a pay a decent amount for it, this is content *any* darkest dungeon will be able to enjoy rather than a rework of the main campaign designed for hardcore fans to make an already hard game EVEN harder. The game warns you that this is not the case, and that you should play this only after beating a regular campaign, and I do wonder how many of the players who walked away disliking the DLC took this warning seriously seeing as quite a few Crimson Court DLC achievements have a higher completion rate than beating the base game on Radiant, or how many base game players really tried to change and adapt their playstyle to fit the new challenges and needs the DLC presents. Infestation can seem annoying or unfair at first, but focusing on collecting a significant amount of trinkets that buff your units against bloodsuckers specifically will help out a lot when dealing with these additional random encounters, while also increasing your ability to deal with threats in the Courtyard. The Crimson Curse is also a new thing you'll have to manage and outside of the Fanatic I think it is an interesting mechanic that adds another level of inventory and item management, and as long as you recognize the necessity to rush the Sanguine Vinters, which produces two vials of blood each week, this too never gets too overwhelming from my experience.

On top of this, the Crimson Court adds incredibly engaging lore, a really cool aesthetic, an interesting new area (although I hate the crocodilian boss and the Epic length layouts are probably a bit **too** long) If you treat the DLC for what it is, that being a harder, new way to experience the Darkest Dungeon campaign, I think it succeeds at that exceptionally well.

Also the Flagellant rules what a sick character whose role as a bleed stacker with consistent, strong healing opens up so many more teamcomps. If you enjoyed your playthrough of the base game and are looking for a different take on it, definitely get Crimson Court. Otherwise, you are probably better off waiting for a sale and buying the DLC for cheap for the Flagellant (who can be enabled seperately from the Crimson Court campaign).",76561198158015575,0,11,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

Good:
The bosses are very difficult and the new dungeons are massive and persistent (you can leave and come back).  Neat to go through.  Note that the first visit is just a normal dungeon, not persistent.

Bad:
There's a lot of padding/grinding.  Each visit to the crimson court requires an invitation.  To get an invitation, you need to wait for your town infestation to grow to high.  Takes several weeks.  Then you need to go into a dungeon and hope to find a gatekeeper.  Kill the gatekeeper before he runs away, and you got an invitation.  You can't store invitations, because each boss requires a new type of invitation.

At first, I enjoyed the DLC because I had played the game before, and the new mechanics brought a fresh breeze and a new challenge to the game, but around the late midgame I started to hate it so much. First of all, the Crimson Curse is not entirely bad, when your characters go into Bloodlust, it’s actually a buff, and a pretty good one nonetheless. HOWEVER, it’s incredibly annoying to micromanage, and even more so when a lot of your people have it, because that means doing Crimson Court dungeons and wasting your time to get enough blood vials so your people don’t die, which can happen.
Now, the second thing that pissed me off are the enemies, with many of them being able to randomly infect your heroes with the Crimson Curse. Now, that wouldn’t be too bad if they were restricted to the new Crimson Court area, BUT THEY AREN’T. EVERY TIME I GO INTO A DUNGEON, I HAVE TO FIGHT THOSE CUNTS ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS, RISKING MORE PEOPLE GETTING INFECTED EVERY TIME. And not just that, they are purposefully made as annoying as possible to fight against, having high dodge and high speed.
But let’s say you don’t mind that too much and would still like to experience this DLC. Then enjoy doing the new, amazing, EPIC length dungeons, which are about as enjoyable as inserting broken glass up your anus.

I like the crimson court for how much new content it adds to the game but also I feel that they should have thought this out more. 
due to the fact that the boss mission are extremely long you'll have to get multiple invitations to go back in to make more progress to the boss, but I feel that the map design and enemy designs for the courtyard make this very poorly designed. Almost every enemy in the courtyard deals stress to whoever they hit which makes Jester almost mandatory or atleast crusader for some stress healing. 
You can camp by finding wine crates and using a shovel on it or use a torch on a cacoon for a 30 stress heal which honestly isn't much with how many enemies you will be fighting.
I'd honestly recommend using a guide since each boss dungeon is scriped and not randomly generated.
[h2] Bosses [/h2]
The bosses are probably the best part, they're mostly well designed and challenging.
The Baron is probably my favorite with how his fight goes but I don't wanna say to much since that kind of ruins it.
[h2] Trinkets [/h2]
The trinkets are insanely good most of them have no downside or a downside that doesn't really do much like giving 10% more stress. My favorite trinket is probably Grave Robber's Sharpened Letter opener it just buffs her damage and accuracy by a ton and with the use of other trinkets can enable her to one shot enemies with upwards of 40 hp on the first turn.
Overall I think that the Crimson Court adds a lot of new content to the game that makes it replayable and interesting but it has it's downsides. The Biggest part of the dlc being the huge courtyard is it's worst designed part bringing Jester feels mandatory just so your heros don't stress out so soon so you can actually make decent progress in the dungeon before needing to leave other than that though I love everything else The Bosses, Trinkets, and The Crimson Curse despite how annoying it can be at times.",76561198355357153,35,22,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

The Crimson Court starts off as something quite interesting, giving us a completely new area, new enemies, new trinkets, and most importantly, the Crimson Curse mechanic.

This mechanic serves as a sort of ""vampire disease"" that your heroes can get by being infected by the new enemies from the DLC. But the thing is, once they have it, you can't just cure it like you would other diseases, matter of fact I haven't even reached that point in my current (blind) playthrough of the DLC so I'm not even sure how much work it takes to get rid of this thing. What I DO know is how fucking annoying it gets and how much it halts your gameplay completely, almost ruining the whole experience.

Look, I love Darkest Dungeon. It's the first turn-based game I've ever actually tried and enjoyed, but this shit SUCKS. First of all, the Crimson Curse isn't something you can just leave there. Not only is it uncurable by normal means, but it constantly fucks with your heroes by simply being there. It starts off as quite interesting, but unravels into a mess of unfun bullshit.
Getting Blood is annoying as shit because the enemies are annoying as shit, they're repetitive and boring and way too powerful in certain situations, but worse than that, they're fucking everywhere. You can't even avoid them properly because the damn bastards start infecting other areas, making fighting them (and therefore getting heroes infected) basically unavoidable.

But not just that, even if you go through all these hurdles and get the Blood, the resource you need to keep your people from NOT DYING, it still sucks ass because of how erratic they become when infected. No matter the current stage of the Curse they're on, they're basically a walking stress nuke. Craving makes them attack other heroes or even themselves, act like idiots and deal stress damage to the party, Wasting makes them want to die and most of the time they'll straight up PASS THEIR TURN because fuck you (which can be LITERALLY fatal in certain situations), and even while they're in the supposed ""best stage"", which is Bloodlust, they're still unstable and stupid, since they might start acting on their own or say more dumb shit that deals stress damage to the whole party. There is a 25% damage buff that accompanies this bullshit, but to me, that IS NOT worth the hassle. I'd rather get my damage from LITERALLY anything else than get it like this and fuck my entire game.

I still haven't been able to cure any of my heroes. The new mission, while interesting, is WAY too fucking long. I get the idea of making a big mission where you get to leave and come back and it's a big arc and all that, but all of this shit combined, the shitty Blood stages, the annoying enemies, the unavoidability of the whole thing, all those things together, make an extremely unpleasant experience that gets really close to ruining Darkest Dungeon's gameplay loop.

With all that said, there are reasons why you should still buy this DLC, that being the new class exclusive to it, the Flagellant. The Flagellant is one of the most creative classes the game has to offer, being a bleeder/support who can input extremely high amounts of bleed while also healing the team at the same time, which he does by being extremely masochistic, becoming stronger as his health depletes, even taking his own health by self-bleed so he can, in turn, heal the others. He gets even stronger if he gets to death's door, gaining damage, speed and crit buffs while in this state, while also unlocking new abilities while at lower health thresholds. He is also the only character in the game to be unaffected by mortality debuffs. This is an extremely fun character to play with and the best part is you can turn him on while leaving the DLC off, so buying it can be worth it you want the Flagellant in your game. If he was a separate DLC, I'd recommend the shit out of that, but as it stands, I have to come here to speak my mind about the bloodletting enthusiast.

So, if you wanna buy this DLC for the new class, go ahead, just remember to deactivate the ACTUAL Crimson Court content when starting the game. In regards to the actual new content, just don't? You could try it after beating the game and seeing what it's all about, but as a new player, and especially as a first timer, avoid this shit like the fucking plague and just enjoy regular old Darkest Dungeon. It's an incredible game, but this DLC only soils the experience.",76561198426287042,286,124,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

You can have the dlc enabled, have access to flagelant, districts, be able to stock up on vials of the blood when adventuring, and yet no insects will spawn and no curse will happen 'till you finally clear the ""burn the hives"" mission.

Sure, ""Town is abuzz"" will be a weekly theme, but the event has manageable effects. By week 15-20 or so, you'd have a decent stockpile (easily 20+ blood vials), adventurer's hall and smithy upgraded to at least tackle veteran difficulty missions, and hopefully a decently diverse roster of heroes very close (but not quite) to lvl 3 resolve.

You can then start the mission, just be aware that the infection will start getting worse every 5 or so weeks, so roughly 9 weeks after you did the first mission, you'll start wanting to clear the Baron, but by then you should easily have lvl 4 heroes in your roster ready to mess him up.",76561198060363983,0,10,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

However, most of the issued have been ironed out, but I shall go into detail in regard to them later. First I have to say that at the current state the DLC is well worth it, with a huge ""BUT"" to consider first though. 

Now, a little bit of spoilers about it (not that it really matters in 2020), it's important to note that this DLC, once started, will inflict an affliction onto your roster, which if you are not prepared, can stress you out by outright threatening your roster to die out due to the Crimson Curse. However, the issue is not as prevailing as it used to be, infected heroes will need blood every couple weeks / dungeon runs, if they go for too long without it (3 checks / graving) they WILL die as a result. 
Fortunately the blood is no longer hard to come by as it used to be (which is the reason for the majority of negative reviews btw), so there are a couple of counter-measures that should be established before heading into the first Crimson Court mission.

[b](Again little bit of spoilers, but this is information one NEEDS to know if one is to actually enjoy this DLC)[/b]

-Hold off from actually starting the first CC mission until you are well established ( small cash reserve and the Sanguine Vitner building which will produce 2 blood every week, allowing you to maintain almost a dozen heroes without the stress of them dying.
-Once the Curse afflicted your roster, supply runs can be launched to stock up on blood
-Drinking holy water reduces the change of heroes getting afflicted by the CC
-Putting cursed heroes into buildings with non-cursed ones WILL spread the curse in the hamlet
-Defeating a boss in the Crimson Court cures all heroes
-Bringing cursed heroes into regular mission will trigger a chance of them being hunted by a wandering boss (you will be warned in the loading screen if he is present tho), so make sure you are prepared facing that threat
-Defeating the final boss of the Crimson Court allows you to cure the Crimson Curse in your Sanatorium whenever you want.

[b]Now to some negatives that still affect the game / DLC:[/b]

-Once you go into the Courtyard, the CC enemies will infest ALL other areas of the game, meaning you will be put on time pressure to clear a courtyard boss after a couple of normal missions, because more and more of your roster will become afflicted.
-The Crimson Court opens up to early for how difficult it is, stressing out newer, unprepared players by forcing all the mechanics onto them if they thought they could tackle the thing.
-The dungeons are a tad bit too big, I had to refer to the revealed maps online so I don't walk circles and dead ends for HOURS due to back tracking / locked gates


[b]Now to the goods, and why it's definitely worth to get:[/b]

-Districts, for very useful and cool bonuses 
-Very cool enemy design and theme
-Flagellant new class which is fun and unique to use
-Entirely different from the base game in terms of how the dungeons are structured and tackled
-Very useful trinkets which provide additional set bonuses 
-Once you got the hang of the game, it still offers a fun challenge after 100+ hours

All in all, I didnt regret jumping into the DLC in the long run, while I initially considered deleting my save file and starting over for how overwhelmed and stressed out I was when the DLC forced all its mechanics on me after I foolishly went into the first Courtyard mission with little preparedness. Now I have finished the whole thing and I am glad I stuck to it and duked it out.

The warning about it being for experienced players isn't a joke. The Crimson Court adds an interesting, challenging, and frankly desperately needed mid-game objective for veteran players that requires resource and roster management to conquer effectively. If you want to get the dlc for your first playthrough, DISABLE CRIMSON COURT, keep on districts and flagellant until you beat the base game AT LEAST ONCE. There are enough negative reviews on a perfectly good expansion that people don't need to give it more bad ratings because it doesn't hold their hands.

Flagellant: 
Great class, fantastic to have another healer on the roster, really unique playing front liner with heals, bleed, and high risk/reward content with abilities that only activate at low HP threshholds. A lot of fun to play with. Only real downside is that he only uses Flagellation Hall for stress relief so you'll want to upgrade that early if you plan on using him.

Districts: 
Fantastic addition, great mid to late game resource dump for when you start accumulating lots of money once you've upgraded all your buildings and don't have to spend as much on your heroes. They give passive bonuses for your town or party members. Not a whole lot to say, just good to have another upgrade path.

Crimson Court:
For better or for worse, game changing. The concept is simple: There's a huge, sprawling new area called the Crimson Court, a new enemy class called Bloodsuckers, and a new game mechanic called the Crimson Curse. The Curse is contracted through certain attacks Bloodsuckers have and can't be cured like other diseases, and cursed heroes require a new item, The Blood, almost constantly, or they risk dying on expeditions or cursing your other heroes when idle in town. This isn't for casuals. It really makes you play differently, wondering whether it'll be worth it to keep a good hero on your roster if it'll risk compromising the rest of the adventurers and prioritising bringing your most valuable heroes to boss fights to kill Crimson Court bosses, which cures the Curse. As you progress through the Court, Bloodsuckers start showing up in other areas in increasingly large numbers, resulting in every expedition becoming riskier the longer you leave the Court unattended, with the final reward being the ability to cure the Curse at the Sanitarium, like any other disease. 

All in all, Crimson Court gives Darkest Dungeon's midgame the kick in the ass it desperately needed. If you're a fan of darkest dungeon, don't listen to casual players badmouthing the expansion just because it wasn't what they wanted.

It is hard. It will affect your progression through the campaign. Whether you're a new player wanting to give it a try or someone looking to try it out on a second playthrough, here are seven bits of advice from someone who's been playing with CC enabled from the beginning:

1. The Flagellant is worth the price of admission alone. He's a frontline healer with powerful damage over time in the form of bleed and the ability to transfer other party members' stress to himself (and he has an inexpensive camp skill that reduces his stress by a ton). He's good in any area except the Ruins. Don't sleep on Reclaim and Redeem, as they are powerful healing skills. Reclaim is not affected by healing skill buffs or debuffs.

2. Don't feel pressured to do the first Courtyard quest as soon as the town event ""The Town is Abuzz"" takes place. It will slightly lower the stress heal your heroes get from activities, but you can sit on that for as long as you want until you feel ready to start the Courtyard's questline. Personally I would recommend going in with a party of level 2 characters. After you complete this first quest, you gain an ""infestation level"". The higher it is, the more often Courtyard enemies will start showing up in other areas.

3. If you need Blood for your Cursed characters, there is always a short quest available in the Courtyard called ""Gather the Blood"" that will net you about 12 with each expedition. You can also build the Sanguine Vintners district, which will add two bottles of Blood to your stock each week for free.

4. The Fanatic is a powerful roaming boss who shows up with a town event when you reach Medium infestation. If you take two or more Cursed characters to a regular dungeon, there's a chance he will follow you in and stalk you. If you aren't specifically geared to fight the Fanatic, just leave. The game will warn you if he's in the dungeon with you with a special loading screen. He won't show up if you have only one party member with the Crimson Curse. He can't show up on boss quests or in the Courtyard, so send all your cursed party members there for XP.

5. You may notice you need ""invitations"" to enter the Crimson Court's Epic quests. These items are dropped by Gatekeepers, which have a chance to spawn as part of any Courtyard mash that appears in a normal biome. They tend to run on Turn 2 and are very fast, so prioritize killing them if you want the drop. The cocoon curio that appears at higher infestation levels will always spawn a Gatekeeper, so that's a semi-reliable way of farming invitations if you need them.

6. Bring lots of food, Blood, Torches, and Shovels to Crimson Court Epic quests. Don't bother bringing any keys, since the special chests that are supposed to give you Crimson Court trinkets will just give you normal loot instead if you use a key on them. Courtyard is always considered to be at 100% torch, but torches are used to clear obstacles, interact with curios, and provide a temporary accuracy buff to your whole party. Shovels are used to smash certain curios that will give you firewood to camp. Don't be afraid of leaving early. The game doesn't expect you to finish it in a single week. If you have a lot of good loot, feel free to abandon the quest. When you return, you'll be in the same place you left off.

7. There's no shame in installing mods to tune the experience to your liking, just like the rest of Darkest Dungeon. Don't let elitists tell you that doing so is ""wrong"" or somehow an incorrect way to play the game.

The Crimson Court DLC adds five news things to the base game: a handful of ancestral trinkets that operate like a ""set"" bonus in a hack-n-slash, a new character called The Flagellant, a new debuff called The Crimson Curse that is essentially vampirism, a new roaming boss called The Fanatic, and the eponoymous Crimson Court area, 

Let's break down these things and discuss how every single one of these new things is ultimately flawed and makes the game WORSE.


First, the ancestral trinkets are all fairly weak, or they require strange positioning to work properly, such as your Vestal being in position 2, where she can't use her best healing, but this also buffs her Divine Comfort. So...why put your healer in harm's way to buff a worse ability, when she could be in the back and use both? The Abomination set requires him to be in the first position for a damage buff. You know, where he can't use most of his not-transformed abilities. Some are pretty solid, but the base trinkets are almost universally better, and the odds on getting both trinkets for one class is extremely low.


Second, The Flagellant. Basic logic would say that this is a character that maybe gets stronger as his health gets low. Well, kind of. He gains a damage buff when below 33% health. Problem is, his damage isn't good. However, ALL of his damage abilities cause excessive amounts of Bleed damage, making him very powerful in most areas. He also creates a healing nova on death (?!) and heals even more when at Death's Door (?!) and has both a personal heal and can heal others if his health is low. So, this means that The Flagellant has a bunch of skills that seem like they were designed by five different people in five different rooms, a buff that doesn't effect him, debuffs that further lower his damage (But not his Bleed!), and this leads to him being essentially a necessary pick. I'm not opposed to having extremely good characters in this game, but just nothing about him makes sense other than ""Position 1, hit enemy until they take 20 Bleed damage per round, heal self to full if about to die"".


Third, The Crimson Curse. The logic behind this is that your characters will need a new item called The Blood. If they don't get this item, they die. You have almost no options to deal with this except being forced to go to the Crimson Court, which is about as fun as a stick in the eye for reasons I'll explain later. The Crimson Curse is caused by new roaming monsters that can appear anywhere. Normally, these fights are just a lttle bit tougher than other enemies at the same level, and that's kind of cool. However, the most common new enemy is called The Sycophant, a giant mosquito. They have extremely high speed, so they always go first, extremely high dodge, so they survive much longer than is necessary, can cause stress and high amounts of bleed, as well as have the highest chance to cause Crimson Curse. Once again, there is nothing you can do about this. You get into a fight, better flip a coin that it's not Crimson Curse monsters (and by that, I mean their spawn rate is so ridicously high, I can say, without exaggeration, about half of your fights in the game will be these things), then flip another that you won't recieve a nearly permanent debuff. Even worse, this waters down the creature pool, because they can spawn anywhere, drastically limiting unique and fun party compositions because you constantly have to plan around the Crimson Court monsters. Sound like fun? Because it's not. The Crimson Curse is also spread by characters sharing buildings with each other during stress relief, so you'll start putting one character at a time in a building, slowing the game's pace to a crawl for fear of making the problem worse. Oh, but that's not all Crimson Curse does that is about as fun as licking a piece of steel wool...

Fourth, The Fanatic. If you take more than one character with The Crimson Curse into a dungeon, you have a large chance that The Fanatic will follow you in. Like The Collector or Shambler, The Fanatic appears randomly instead of a normal group of enemies. Once again, cool idea, like you're being hunted by a vampire hunter. The issue is that The Fanatic is completely unbalanced on a very basic level. He always begins with surprise for arbitrary difficulty increase. Begins the battle with ""Sentence Rendered"", removing one of your characters from the battle and attaching them to a burning stake, not unlike the Hag battle with her cauldron. You have an arbalist in the back? Too bad. He get your healer? You just lost. Why do you lose? Well, he gets three actions per round! Why? Arbitrary difficulty! Stress damage, bleed damage, stress over time, party removal, The Fanatic is easily the hardest fight in the game, drops the mostly terrible Crimson Court trinkets and a SINGLE USE Crimson Curse Cure. There is literally no reason to fight him. He's not impossible, just frustrating, boring, random, and pointless. It's more expedient to just leave the dungeon if the game says he's followed you in, and when I DON'T WANT TO EXPERIENCE CONTENT I PAYED FOR, there's a problem.

Then, we come to The Crimson Court itself. The main problem with the Crimson Court is that there are three (technically four) levels to it. Unlike the other areas of the game, these areas have the same map every single time, and you're expected to go as far as you can, then retreat and return with a different party where you left off. This is really cool the first time, but every subsequent time, you find yourself just rolling your eyes and looking up the map online. Otherwise, there is a lot of time backtracking through empty rooms, looking for that one room you missed that has the key in it, so you can walk all the way back, to open a door, and do it again, ending with a pretty neat boss for every level. It isn't as bad as the other problems, but it's tedious, boring, and the only pluses to doing so are...Crimson Court trinkets, and every level cures everyone in your party of Crimson Curse. 

So, let's recap. A permanent debuff caused by roaming mobs that you can't stop because they attack first, which causes a roaming boss to attack that is ridiculously unbalanced to the rest of the game, and the only way to stop it is to go into an area that causes the curse MORE OFTEN, that is boring to play, to get trinkets that aren't very good, and the main reason to do it at all is to GET RID OF THE PERMANENT DEBUFF IN THE FIRST PLACE. This means that the DLC is a giant cycle to FIX PROBLEMS THAT IT INTRODUCED. 

Sorry, but that sucks. This DLC isn't fun, it weighs the entire game down with unncessary frustration and flow-breaking mechanics, fails to create a proper ticking clock to encourage exploration, and literally the BEST part is that you can turn off the Crimson Court, but keep The Flagellant. Don't get me wrong, it's not like the DLC is broken or too difficult, it just isn't fun on a fundamental level. 

Without a major overhaul, this DLC is dead on arrival, period.",76561197987962663,647,61,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

A sickness so virulent, so insidious, it is more a curse than a mere disease... and also a heavy annoyance that this DLC brings among many other things.

The new Hero is called Flagellant and he truly is a depiction of a ""High-Risk, High-Reward"" character, being able to take on harm to help other Heroes, having powerful abilities only able to be used at low health, and, when stressed (""Rapturous"", a unique affliction that's the only possible outcome to hitting 100 Stress with the Flagellant), receiving a neat buff to damage, the Flagellant is a character that truly feels different from the usual.

Now this is where things take a change for the worst (or at least stop being completely positive).

This DLC really only ""starts"" once you take on the first mission at the Courtyard, where it basically shows you the ropes while giving some (unexpected) challenges for your team. And as soon as you complete this mission things will change drastically. Enemies from the Courtyard will start appearing in other regions, which would be ok, considering the whole ""infestation"" aspect of this DLC, but they are annoying because of 3 things: Stress (almost EVERY enemy in this DLC just loves to stress your team), Chevaliers (Yes, I made a separate comment for those guys. They're VERY annoying, hitting hard and debuffing your team) and the Crimson Curse. The new Disease added in this DLC. This Crimson Curse is one of the worst additions of this DLC. It's supposed to be a truly horrible disease that, although a menace, can be ""useful"" to some. The problem is that even when it's ""useful"" it still is an annoyance to your team by being basically an affliction that constantly needs to be ""quelled"" with The Blood (a new item this DLC brings that basically can work on some curios and is mainly used to help with heroes with the Crimson Curse), so you either make a lot of expeditions to the dangerous Courtyard in search of more vials of the damned thing, make the Sanguine Vintners to help you on the whole ordeal or you suffer by the hands of... the mosquito gods (or just goddess) and watch as your characters slowly die due to blood addiction.

Quests are so so SO long. With more than 50 (!!) rooms and even more halls, they are truly exhausting. Then they also require invitations that you can only get by killing Courtyard enemies that are roaming/breeding in other regions. 1 quest can require more than 10 different expeditions to be cleared.

Enemies are VERY annoying, which is quite fitting for half-mosquito maniacs, but they are EXTREMELY annoying. High dodge, a lot of stress attacks, the already mentioned Crimson Curse... then there's also the fact that when they use their trademark Crimson Court move, ""[b]The Thirst[/b]"" (and I have to praise the devs on this one, I liked how almost all of them share that particular move. It is extremely fitting), they heal, get new moves and are buffed. It's so stressful (hey!) to be close to killing that one annoying verming then having him use that move, infect your hero with the Crimson Curse and also Crit Heal to almost full health... Still though, I loved how they morph to more grotesque forms when they use (and hit) that move. The transformation is great and fitting.

Music? It's great. I love how Stuart Chatwood managed to make ""buzzing"" a part of the combat theme. It goes very well with the whole ""mosquito infestation"" theme of the DLC. Truly one of the best parts of this DLC.

The Courtyard looks amazing. A swamp that very clearly shows that once it was a place of respect now consumed by the infestation and the invading nature... so good. The soft buzzing of mosquitoes and the sound of dripping blood do wonders at establishing the themes of the DLC.

Bosses are... tough. But one that really annoyed me and I consider the strongest and most annoying of this DLC was the only one that's not even half-mosquito. Yes, I'm talking about The Fanatic. This one guy will hunt down expeditions that have Heroes with the Crimson Curse (because it was already easy enough as it was) and will absolutely be a relentless enemy or, at the Ancestor puts it: ""an animal - rabid, destructive, and incapable of nuanced understanding."" Capable of choosing one of your Heroes down to receive constant unstoppable damage akin to Hag's Cauldron while also dishing out constant damage, debuffs and buffing himself, he's truly one annoying maniac. If you DO defeat him, though, you'll receive 2 special items called ""The Cure"", which, as the name implies, can cure your Hero of the Crimson Curse once. Yay. So then you can use that useful little thing on your afflicted Jester and Highwayman on Death's Door so that you can escape the Dungeon because he absolutely destroyed your team but at least now you don't want to drink blood flavoured wine. So if you are going to a ""normal"" quest and have one or more heroes with the Crimson Curse I hope you are prepared for judgement.

One thing that this DLC also brings are special Hero-specific trinkets. A lot of them. 2 for each hero. We have 17 Heroes (Including the Flagellant and the Musketeer but excluding the Shieldbreaker because her Crimson Court trinkets are received through nightmares) so 17 x 2 and we have 34 trinkets. Neat. While doing Crimson Court quests you might find these special ""Crimson Court"" trinkets, so you slowly fill your collection of trinkets... then the ""proper"" Crimson Court quests end and you have to [spoiler]fight this stupidly big and buff stone statue repeatedly if you want to gather all of the remaining CC trinkets[/spoiler] which isn't much of an interesting task. What makes you hunt for the trinkets, though, is the fact that they are related to the heroes lore-wise and more lore is always nice and that they are also very powerful, giving special buffs if using both at the same time.

Even though this is a DLC that could be considered as making the game ""worse"", I'd be lying if I said I outright disliked it. Sure, some things are indeed annoying, some things really felt exhaustive but, in the end, I had fun. And I can understand (or at least believe I understand) why the devs made it so, although I was very close to disliking it.

[b]OBS: A very neat thing that Darkest Dungeon allows you to do is select exactly which parts of a DLC you want, so, let's say, you want the Flagellant and the districts but don't want the Crimson Court? That's ok. You can do that. So if you just want the Flagellant and Districts but not to drown in Blood Flavoured Wine™... you can do that. I'd recommend doing that if you just want the Flagellant, as he's honestly a great character.[/b]

I really can't. I'll give a brief summary of the things I enjoy and which I don't enjoy, but to make things short: 
It really makes the game experience worse, rather than better. 

For the positives, well... 
The new class is very nice, and enjoyable to use. It has unique mechanics and once you get the hang of him, he's a very satisfying addition to a team.
New trinkets are also nice. They add a bit more variety and expand things, rather than restrict them; this line will make sense later, when I get into the negatives.
The Districts that have been added are also a nice touch, but that's about all I can say for them; they add a little more to do and upgrade in your Hamlet. They're just little bonus points, for the most part, but it's still nice.


Alright, now to move on to the bulk of the things added by the Crimson Court... which coincidentally also brings us into the negatives.

[h1]The Crimson Curse![/h1]

Firstly, the Crimson Curse-mechanic is a plague on the gameplay. Heroes have a chance to be affected by the Crimson Curse whenever they're hit by a Bloodsucker-type enemy; the type of enemy introduced with the Crimson Court DLC.
A hero affected by the Crimson Curse will need to be fed the Blood, a specific item dropped by Crimson Court-enemies and in recently introduced missions that only serve the purpose to retrieve the Blood. If heroes can't be fed Blood, they start to wither away; their curse first worsening (adding a harsher debuff), their behavior growing more erratic (such as refusing to be healed or stressing other heroes out whenever they are hit, or investigate a curio), and finally, if they're not fed while wasting away? They die. 
Naturally, this requires you to regularly go on supply runs in the Crimson Court to retrieve Blood for your heroes. These runs don't advance anything, they're only there to get you Blood, and you are only facing Bloodsuckers, which in turn have a chance to afflict your heroes with the Crimson Curse, requiring you to run into the Court more often. Very thrilling!

As if that wasn't enough, heroes have a chance to spread their affliction to fellow heroes if they are sharing the same stress-relief activity; meaning if you put two heroes to chill at the bar, one of which is afflicted by the Crimson Curse, and a third hero to gamble, there's a high chance that Hero A will afflict Hero B at the bar.
There's also a slight chance he'll infect Hero C who is just gambling, for good measure.
Naturally, this results in you pondering whether or not you will risk putting ANY non-Crimson Curse heroes into the same building as an infected hero; and that means if one of your Crimson Curse heroes decides to have an existential crisis that causes him to not leave the bar, they'll essentially lock down the entire building for 2 weeks, because putting anyone in there will result in MORE Crimson Curse.

This wouldn't be so bad, if heroes afflicted by the Crimson Course wouldn't behave like aggressive drug addicts that occasionally beat up their team members and drool over every injury inflicted. However, to make things worse, there's also a completely psychopathic ""miniboss"", the Fanatic, which has a chance to spawn if your group in a dungeon has heroes afflicted by the Crimson Curse. He's a rather challenging boss, and while hard to beat, he can actually drop pretty good stuff; except for a mediocre trinket that increases a heroes damage against the Fanatic and the Fanatic alone.

So you're starting to see why the Crimson Curse becomes a problem. It makes your heroes act completely idiotic in very frustrating ways, requires you to run missions that have a high chance of getting more heroes inflicted, and makes it so you can't have your heroes relax freely, because if you do so, they'll afflict even more heroes with Terminal Addiction Disease, AKA the Crimson Curse.

But hey, that all sounds like it needs to snowball, right? 
Wrong.
Which leads us to the next point, the 
[h1]Crimson Court[/h1]

Crimson Court-missions are classified as ""Epic"". The Dungeons are meant to be long, challenging runs, that you keep interrupting and re-entering to make sure you're in top condition as you work your way towards the boss, unlocking color-coded doors as you go. The problem is that you can't freely re-enter on a whim, you require invitations. But how do you get invitations? Well, simple. You kill Gatekeepers! Gatekeepers are spawned in regular levels, sometimes. And what sounds like careful management of ressources, to see if you can't just push the run in the Court a little longer and risk facing harsh conditions because you just don't have any more invitations is actually just a chore.

In the background of your normal missions, the Infestation of Bloodsuckers constantly builds; as it reaches its peak, you get at least one group of Bloodsuckers in any dungeon you run. I at least get two on average, in a short dungeon. One time I got 4 groups of Bloodsuckers. 
Yes, this means that you can potentially face more Bloodsuckers than the enemy-type you're expected to face in a dungeon. 
And yes, they can also cause Crimson Curse.
These groups also don't have much variety, which means you'll eventually KNOW what a group of Bloodsuckers will do ahead of time, but you won't be able to prevent it. 
And what's the only way to get the Infestation-level lower? You probably guessed it: Finish the ""Epic"" quest, and slay the boss, to get a brief respite from the Crimson Curse and the Bloodsuckers from over at the Crimson Court.

So you end up with an overabundance of Crimson Curse-afflicted heroes, requiring you to run short Crimson Court-missions to get your Blood, where more heroes will get afflicted, which restricts your ability to freely let heroes relax, and also increases the odds to have to face a psychopath that has a fetish for burning people on a pyre, all the while groaning in frustration as you face another set of mosquitos to get your 900th invitation to the Crimson Court where you can run around in an [strike]overly long[/strike] Epic quest where you hope you don't die of alligators.

And that sums up my problem with the Crimson Court DLC: 
It doesn't really expand the core gameplay, as much as it overwrites it. It creeps into your gameplay like a set of horrible, blood-red strangling. It seems horrifying at first, because of the interesting concept, but you soon realize it's more and more of a nuisance that just keeps you from doing the things you might actually WANT to do. The Crimson Curse and the Crimson Court try to hog the spotlight in the worst of ways; by pushing aside the basics, and replacing them with increasingly frustrating, and less varying mechanics. 

Now, the fellows over at Red Hook are obviously still ironing things out, so this MIGHT change; chances of enemies infecting heroes have been tinkered with, and the acquisiton of Blood has also already been worked on (though in my opinion, the change was alright at best). So there is still hope for the Bloodsuckers to end up something fun and interesting.",76561198037289619,0,29,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

It isn't for people who are already struggling a bit too much with the main game. It's for people who are looking to add a new layer of difficulty on top of what's already on the table, and I do think that Devs should have clarified that a bit.

Now that being said, I don't think it's badly designed or unrewarding at all. I honestly never start a new campaign without the Crimson Court because after a ton of hours the base game can't keep up with it's veteran players.

A lot of the negative reviews seem to be caused by frustration and I understand being tired of setbacks but that's exactly what the game is trying to do. They want you to fail at some point to learn from what you did wrong and they want you to overcome something that defeated you beforehand. This is the has been the design philosophy of DD and this DLC only expands on it. They are putting new roadblocks for you to fail, only to be conquered later.

Here are some Pros and Cons in my opinion:

Pros:
-Flagellant (my favourite hero)
-More complex enemies to adapt to
-Difficult Bosses
-New Region
-District mechanic which helps a lot with the late game
-Great trinkets

Cons:
-The Crimson Curse is a bit too hard to adapt to for new players
-I wish Fanatic could drop better rewards as it's not worth the risk to take him on most of the time

I have nothing but good things to say about the base game. The expansion is not bad either, but there are so many questionable design decisions you wonder why the Dev's chose to release it in its state.

Before I get to the positives, there are quite a few negatives to get out of the way.

- Poor implementation: This expansion should be gated to a certain stage of your Hamlet as most newer playthroughs will have a hard time dealing with the new challenge of managing the Crimson Curse. While it is not impossible to deal with if the Hamlet is not fully upgraded, it is harder when the curse spreads and you only have so much blood. You are forced to go out on ""Wine runs"" to get more. This affects the overall pacing and delays progress.

- Epic Dungeons: I actually didn't mind these at first, until I discovered that they are not randomly generated and have dead ends that can take up to 15 minutes to return to the correct path (why is this acceptable?). This wouldn't be such a bad thing if there were lots of new enemies to keep the runs interesting, but you'll have met just about every monster type within the first 5 minutes of your ""Champion"" epic run. I guess their length does add to the bleak feel of the expansion, but it could be so much leaner/punchier.

- Put the hardest boss on the first ""Crimson Curse lifted"" event: Not talking about the Crocadillian, though he can be a pest on higher difficulties, I'm talking about The Baron. While the fight is fun and the gimmick is really interesting, you will only be successfull with certain compositions as The Baron has far too many turns and health. This wouldn't be so bad if it was on Champion level, but he is on Veteran which mean't I had to level up a new team from scratch to take him on successfully. I believe he could have worked better as the Boss before the Countess as The Viscount is laughably easy.

- The Fanatic : Disappears after you've beaten the Countess. He was such a cool wandering boss and I'm actually sad that there's no other way to trigger his event.

- Nothing much to do after the Countess is beaten: You now have an easy way to address the annoying curse, but you'll almost never use it as the CC monsters never stray outside of the Courtyard. Should you decide to revist the Courtyard, you'll have the option of repeatedly fighting the The Garden Guardian; probably one of the least entertaining fights in the entire game. There is little incentive to return to the courtyard because of this reason.

All of these negatives could have been addressed if the Epic quests were shorter and more focused, Boss order was rejigged, roaming still exists after beating CC and maybe a few monster additions to keep things feeling fresh. For the endgame (intead of the Garden Guardian), even if they recycled base game Bosses with a Crimson twist, it would have made for more interesting grinding.

In summary, I'd much rather have a shorter but sweet experience instead of feeling like I've seen it all within the first 20 minutes of playing. 



Now for the positives:
- Flagellant: Easily one of the most versitile classes in the game. A healer and a tank that almost never dies? I'll take ten.
- Districts: Now you can take all the useless artifacts that pile up and apply them to new buildings that give perma stat bonuses. A great way to give you something to work towards when most of the content has been explored
- Story and the atmosphere were great additions. It defintely left me wanting more.
- The countess fight was unique and tense. Just wish there was some kind of endgame cutscene to resolve her death.
- Music and Art are strong as always. I really hope there is a way to get an artwork book for the expansions, similar to the base game.


Overall: Great additions to the base game at the cost of some repetition to get the full experience. For its price, it's not a bad purchase. Just be sure you know what you're getting into before you enable the content as it may create some unfavorable playthroughs.",76561197982037209,356,83,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

I'm going to break down each aspect of the DLC for those who are unsure as I was.

First of all, you don't have to do the Courtyard missions right away at the start of your DD campaign. When in the campaign screen, you can choose which aspects of this DLC to activate. So you can activate the Flagellant class and the Districts right away and then leave the Courtyard for later if you so choose (or not at all!).

The Courtyard area itself is pretty well made in my opinion and is somewhat different to the main 4 areas in the base game. The main missions that have a boss at the end (of which there are 3; not counting the intro mission) are enormous sprawling dungeons that require more than one entry and a party regroup, so you're not likely to beat each one in a single expedition. They have entirely new curios to interact with, and the torchlight mechanic is not present here. 

The DLC also introduces a bunch of new enemies, the bloodsuckers. They usually appear in the Courtyard. However, as the infestation grows, they will start appearing in other areas of the game as well. Some people have said it's repetitive to fight them as there are only about 6-7 of these new regular enemies that keep coming up a lot, but I personally did not find them too repetitive as they come up in different team compositions which might require you to adjust your strategies. Moreover, these enemies also have 2 forms. If they happen to drink blood of one of your heroes, they change into a more hideous form and have a new look and new attacks.

Perhaps the thing that was offputting me the most about getting this DLC is the infamous Crimson Curse, which your heroes can get infected with, which makes them crave blood. However, after having played through this DLC, the curse mechanic is actually not so bad at all. The debuffs the curse causes are very minor (it's more like a double-edged sword actually and can be made to work in your favour), and the blood craving can be temporarily satiated by blood vials that drop very frequently. In fact you can even take your party to a blood-gathering quest to collect many of those blood vials. I did those 2-3 times, and together with blood found from other, more random sources, I ended up having a huge stack of 30 blood vials before I even took down the first Courtyard boss. By the time I went for the final boss of the DLC, this stack of blood grew to 50 vials. So fear not, you won't be short on blood. I've never had a hero die due to the curse.

Speaking of bosses of this DLC, they are challenging. Perhaps somewhat more challenging than most bosses in the base game, though I think it's mostly due to them having 3 and at times even 4 actions per turn. So new strategies are required to approach them. But if you've found the base game very hard already, you might want to delay going into the Courtyard until you've gotten a hang of the combat.

There is only one thing I didn't like about this DLC, and that is the invitations mechanic. The thing about boss Courtyard levels is that you cannot just take a party there. You require an invitation item, and each visit into those giant levels will consume 1 invitation. However, the invitations-carrying enemies do not start appearing until the infestation in other dungeons reaches High, and that takes at least 10 or so in-game weeks. To me that just feels like a pointless padding that forces you to wait for no reason. I would've rather preferred to be able to go into the Courtyard levels at any time, because waiting around doesn't really add any challenge and is only there to waste your time.

Lastly, The Flagellant class is a rather interesting one, though a little hard to get a hang of at first as it's quite different to most other hero classes. The Districts buildings each provide small passive bonuses to specific hero classes once built, though each one requires a tonne of heirlooms, so you might find it a little grindy if you wish to build those.

Overall, this is a solid DLC. If you enjoyed the base game and you found its difficulty just right and want something new, then you should enjoy Crimson Court as well. In some ways it is harder than the base game, but with new things it offers, you have more ways of dealing with the challenges, not only the new ones, but also the old ones.",76561197989390503,675,211,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

Let's start with the positives:
-The new hero is fantastic. Very balanced, and isn't overshadowed by any other heroes.
-The new trinkets, even though you have to go to the Courtyard to get them, are also fantastic. They are well worth your time (unlike the Courtyard).
-The new enemy and map art is beautiful. It's a shame you have to venture into the Courtyard to see this wonderful art though.
-I personally like the new traveling boss. We've never seen anything like that before in this game, aside from the Collector, so it's a nice touch. (He is very difficult to kill though)
-Districts are alright. They are very expensive permanent bonuses to both heroes and your hamlet, which are in no way necessary but are nice to have nonetheless.

Now for the negatives:
-The Courtyard is the absolute worst thing in existance. In the second mission alone there are over FIFTY rooms to explore; most of which have absolutely nothing in them. And once you find the place you are supposed to go to, it is locked. So you have to backtrack through countless halways (which stress your heroes out while you walk through them) to find a key which may or may not even fit the door. It is like an eternal labyrinth of suffering and torture, with the only reward being trinkets that you won't get to keep anyway because your units will all collapse of heart attakcs before you can retreat (you cannot camp in the Courtyard, even though it is the largest dungeon to date).

-EDIT: Due to the recent drop rate increase for the Blood, managing the Curse has now become astronomically easier. You should have no problem getting The Blood. 

-The difficulty spike is also flabergasting. A level 3 Courtyard quest is the equivalent of a level 5 regular quest. DO NOT bring ANYONE low level to the Courtyard. They will die, and it will be your fault. 

-The ""Infection"" mechanic is also infuriating. Each regular dungeon run you do after entering the Courtyard increases your chances of running into Courtyard enemies in future runs . Essentially, you don't even have to enter the Courtyard to get infected. The infection follows you wherever you go. It is inescapable. It is everywhere. 

I would highly reccomend that if you purchase the DLC you not enable the Courtyard. Just enjoy the new class and the Districts. If Red Hook decides to fix the Courtyard sometime in the future, my mind may change. But for now, I'd give the DLC a solid 6/10 because of how dreadful the Courtyard is.",76561198325124258,77,2,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

[h1]Pros:[/h1]
+The new character: the Flagellant, is a strong addition to the roster and can be enabled independently of the Crimson Court once bought. If you’re going to get this at some point just buy it now and wait till another play through to enable the Court so you can play with the Flagellant, he’s been nerfed but is still useful as a powerful stress healer, damage sponge, and damage over time dealer.

+ New area with new enemies, music, bosses, and game mechanics.

+ The new enemies are great because they are very thematic and have very specific move sets making each feel very unique to fight, not just damage numbers. You can manipulate them once you know how they function which rewards your knowledge of your enemies.

+ Art style is awesome, as per usual.

+ The trinket sets for each character which you can only get from the new area stretch from mediocre to absolutely necessary, with tantalizing additional hints to the lore of each character.

+ Districts are a nice way to spend artifacts once you max out your hamlet and give effects ranging from mediocre to extremely useful (like the granary, cartographer’s guild, or bank).

+ The new ‘epic’ quest mechanic is interesting, instead of a randomly generated dungeon you have to explore a persistent dungeon over several expeditions. But this also has drawbacks…

[h1]Cons:[/h1]
- The epic quests to the Courtyard encourage a very specific type of playstyle, i.e. heroes that are self sufficient. You can’t bring firewood to camp for stress healing or buffs, so you need to rely on heroes that can go as long as possible without rest. While this isn’t inherently a bad thing it takes away so much choice about which party members to bring and which tactics to use. Each of the Courtyard dungeons is so long you’ll need maybe a half a dozen expeditions so you’ll just be slogging around with the same party again and again. But that’s not all!...

- You need invitations to enter the Courtyard epic dungeon, i.e. you have a limited number of times you can try your luck at the dungeon before you will run out and need to do something else. This isn’t too bad if you know how to cheese the system using the right combo of heroes and fasting seals so you don’t need food and can keep your party going forever. But that just leads back to the previous con with stagnant party composition. Boring! But this gets FAR worse at the highest level where you NEED stop the expeditions frequently due to the massive amount of abuse heaped on you by the high level enemies. I just got fed up and installed a mod to disable the need for invitations.

- The titular Crimson Curse, the disease any enemy from the Courtyard can inflict, sucks. And I don’t mean that it’s debilitating, it actually has both strengths and weaknesses, but that it acts like an Affliction and can randomly cause your character to do things. I HATE it when my party members refuse to listen to me and get themselves killed. That is why I try so ardently to avoid Afflictions. The problem is, you can’t avoid the Crimson Curse, every single hero that goes there will be by a large majority infected. If you ignore the Courtyard eventually the enemies there start showing up everywhere else infecting you anyway. So, you just have to angrily live with it. I’ve rage quit over a hero who is near death and refuses to heal or be healed and dies because of it! What was I supposed to do!?

- All of the bosses were a let down. While the long treck to each makes the encounter build up a large amount of tension half of the worry was that you weren’t going to make the marathon required to get to them, or if you did that you wouldn’t have the right party members to take them on, not due to the boss itself. The fact that you only get to fight each once is a further let down as you don’t get time to build a repertoire with them like the others. Even further….

- All of the bosses trophies weren’t worth the time to get them. I never used a single one of them even once. Compared to the trophies you get from the vanilla bosses the items the Court bosses give you are terribly mediocre, mostly centering on the Crimson Curse which I also hate.

- And now, the thing I find the most detestable, the reason I recommend you not enable this DLC in your first playthrough: [b]The Difficulty. [/b]

The first 2 epic dungeons weren’t that bad but the final level 6 dungeon was a nightmarish meatgrinder, I would take fully maxed out heroes there with trinkets and a party composition that could make short work of even long level 5 dungeons and have to abandon the mission a few rooms later with a party that was nearly dead. It was devastating… BUT WAIT! That’s not why I am angry, I kept going in the face of adversity, I found the right party composition, I weathered the storm. I became so good the Countess herself, the final boss of the DLC, was a disappointment to me. 

The real point and what’s really unforgivable is that [b]the level 6 crimson court is harder than the Darkest Dungeon itself.[/b] I was so afraid after what I experienced in the Courtyard that the Darkest Dungeon was a letdown. I came close to dying only once in all of the Darkest Dungeon quests, and that once only because I had a bad party composition for the type of quest I was running. It was still shocking and surprising, but it didn’t have anywhere near the impact it should have had as the crowning jewel of the game and it is because of this DLC.  


That is why I think it’s only a good addition on a second+ playthrough, so you definitely, absolutely, should NOT enable this DLC your first time through.

While it appears to be a meager addition for an expansion, it does breathe some new life into the game. Ive played over 100 hours of DD, and its one of my favorite games, so this DLC was a welcome addition. Its not as great as I expected and hoped, but that doesnt mean it isnt worth getting. It adds an interesting new mechanic, the crimson curse, which is a new disease. 

The only thing is it cant be cured, and adds MAJOR debuffs to your characters. Its a peculiar feature, Im not quite sure why they added it in. It adds some flavor to the game lore, but other than that its been quite annoying. Your characters basically become strung out on blood and CONSTANTLY need to consume blood vials which are dropped from enemies, or else they get an even larger debuff slapped on. This means that yet another precious inventory slot will need to be spent on bringing blood with you on every single outing. Making matters worse is unlike other diseases, the crimson curse is guaranteed. Basically if you get hit once by a certain enemy (which happens to be the most common one encountered) that character will be infected with the incurable affliction. It will be mostly impossible for you to avoid it, and any hero you send into the court area WILL be infected. This ended up exiling my top heroes, who are now relocated exclusively to the court area, since they already have the disease and I dont want the perma debuffs on all of my heroes.

While this feature had the potential to be an innovative and unique gameplay mechanic, it sadly misses the mark of greatness and ends up only being slightly interesting and irritating. On the bright side amidst the debuffs are meager buffs, for example despite having less health and resistences you get a tiny speed bonus, which is too small to be helpful but it at least somewhat balances things. 

In fact, Id consider it more of a gimmick than a gameplay mechanic.

Other than that quip, the DLC is very cheap and offers some new content that will give you a reason to start a new game and delve into the madness yet again. If DD wasnt one of my all time favorite games Id probably have a harsher opinion of this content, but overall Id say its a DEFINATE PURCHASE, especially for fans of the game. Id  buy anything these guys at Redhook put out, especially if it has anything to do with DD. I am grateful they made this and am enjoying the content so far. Its just too bad they couldnt have made the crimson curse more interesting or dynamic.

First of all, i would like to say that this DLC is not reccommended for first time players, and is absolutely designed with veterans in mind, you will have a bad time if the court is your first DD experience, because it will cut you down mercilessly.

Overall, i highly reccommaned the DLC if you have already played a reasonable amount of the game, understand hero synergies, compositions, trinkets, and other mechanics that often lead to a good chance of success.

[h1] The Crimson Curse! [/h1]

The crimson curse is a special disease introduced in the DLC, it is pretty debilitating, not because of it's stat minuses, as they are actually very minor, something that many reviewers fail to recognise (minus 10% hp, minus 5% to stun, blight and bleed) and, also omitted of course, is that the curse gives a bonus to speed, one of the most important stats in the game if you know what you're doing.

This is inflicted by most courtyard enemies, getting hit by a specific attack by them (the thirst) there is a chance you can get a disease, and the curse can be resisted by disease resist like normal diseases, so if you're very afraid, you can make sure that's high on your heroes to reduce the chances even further.

the disease gets worse, however, going through three stages, passive, craving and wasting. if a hero is passive, he has those minor debuffs, craving, the debuffs becoming a little more severe, except the hp loss, and the speed actually [i]increases[/i]. unfortunately, in craving, the character can do some minor, but predictable ""random effects"", like being afflicted but much more manageable. these include minor stressing of party (around +7 instead of the normal +10/+15 of afflictions) and are infrequent, another effect is the hero moving forward in the party a single space.

when a character is wasting however, this is when things get scary, the character can die if not given blood, and the curse debuffs are severe, however taking the time to gather blood and use it smartly and scarcely can lead to a fine amount as well as making sure to keep it wherever you find it.

another issue with the curse, however, is that when the infestation gets to medium levels, a Fanatic will show up, and begin hunting your heroes. he has a chance to show up in missions with two or more curse afflicted heroes, and i see a lot of people complaining about this guy.

easy fix, manage your parties so you only have one or two people with the curse going into a normal mission, and save your heavy cursed parties for courtyard missions, i haven't seen him once.

the boss itself is challenging, and terrifying, maybe on the level of a shambler, and not being able to plan for him means he can pop up on you at a bad time and really ruin your run. however if you kill him, you will get some great look, court related trinkets, and even on occasion, [b]an item to cure the curse[/b]

[b]now, the main things that the main reviews on the front page do not mention.[/b]

giving a craving character blood will put them in a fourth state, BLOODLUST. bloodlusted characters get a massive 25% damage buff, big resistance buffs (except bleeding) and a big speed buff. they do have the sort of random effects like craving, except in addition they can randomly heal stress from themselves. this lasts a massvie 22-30 rounds! making one of the BEST BUFFS IN THE GAME.

another thing no one mentions is that the curse is so potant, heroes that have it are IMMUNE TO DISEASES.

suddenly, the curse seems a lot less bad than people have outlined, doesn't it?

[h1]The Courtyard[/h1]

The courtyard is a new zone in the game, and it's quite spooky. A theme of aristocratic parties growing more and more immoral via wine and peer pressure, eventually leading these monsters to become actual monsters via their terrifying thirst for horrific deeds.

The courtyard is tough, and after the first mission you complete court enemies show up in other missions, progressively getting more and more common. so it's recommended you wait until you're well prepared before doing this mission, as people who know this game should be, as it looks like that sort of ""special"" mission like the darkest dungeon, or a boss (you can tell from the quest rewards, if you've played the game a lot)

however, after this, you are able to go on an ""epic"" mission, this mission is so long that you are not expected to complete it in a single run, with one party, you are expected to go as far as you can, abandon the quest, and when you try it again your new party will pick up from where the previous one left off, which is a very interesting and awesome mechanic, as a multitude of heroes all work together for the same, massive goal.

access to the epic mission required invitiations, which are dropped by a certain enemy called a gatekeeper in most other missions, in crimson court enemy parties. these generally become very common and after gathering a few you'll find you start discarding them in favour of more loot (again, assuming you know what you're doing with this game.)

the epic quests are a huge labryrinthe of multiple bosses, keys, doors, branching paths, the kind of typical video game dungeon, culminating in an epic and unique boss fight that will greatly challenge you.

an issue with it is that the stress you gain from just being there so long will slowly wear you down, however the dungeon has two types of stress reducing curios that should help mitigate this if you know what you're doing.

[h1] The Flagellant [/h1]

A brief section about this guy.

he is cool, effective, and a pleasure to use. something darkest dungeon has never had which is an excellent feeling is a guy that benefits from taking lots of damage, to such a point where an enemy hits him, with stress or damage, and i'm like ""yes! hit him more!"" it feels so great.
he can steal bleeds, blights and marks from allies, he can heal a termendous amount by taking lots of damage first, he can even take stress from allies and take it himself.

when the flagellant hits deaths door, everyone in the party is healed, and he gets a big buff while there, risky yes, but very rewarding, especially because the speed boost he gets means he can self heal as soon as it's his turn.

couple this with the fact that he can only be afflicted with one kind, Rapturous, makes him a fairly predictable risk. while rapturous, the flagellant will hurt himself (which is useful) but occasionall hurt others, he also gains big buffs, and minus dodge (again, often helpful with this oddball hero). this makes him a very exciting and fun hero to use, easily one of my favourites now.


All in all it seems that many people who have played this need a simple dose of ""git gud"" in order to appreciate it, or it could be the case that, since i am playing this a month after release, that many complaints have been changed and i'm getting the updated experience, if so i'm here to correct now out of date information and give my thoughts on my experience so far, which is having sincere difficulty putting it down.",76561198010761326,566,5,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

However I cannot recommend this expansion as it is a grind and honestly not fun.

The main issue is the way the Crimson Curse is implemented. My argument is that the game feels a lot more like a RNG chaotic fest, which doesn't make the game more fun, just grindier. The DLC brings out the worst aspects of the game in terms of RNG.

Crimson cursed heroes often lose agency - passing turns, refuse to be healed, hitting and killing their friends, refuse to be healed or destressed in camp. You cannot prevent heroes from getting cursed as there is a ton of courtyard enemies everywhere when the infection reaches a high level. Yes it may be a low chance, but over time, over many dungeons, you will lose fights because of this mechanic that you have little way of mitigating. 

This also extends to exploration as cursed heroes often interact with curios (again loss of player agency). For base DD you know to immediately kill some quirks (e.g. Curious) that takes player agency away but you cannot do so in this case until it is cured. And you cannot cure it until you have explored the courtyard which is locked behind invites and takes many repeated questing sessions.

You have to have blood (and there are farming quests for this) but this isn't interesting - its a grind because what you want is to see content, not run on a treadmill to constantly level up heroes to replace those that died, or constantly looking out for blood, or seeing the same courtyard creatures in every dungeon when the infection goes everywhere.

What made the base game interesting is that I felt I had more control and agency over things. Dying to shambler because of no torches? My fault. Over-stressed afflicted heroes not doing what their told? My fault for not managing stress. Going ruins? Bring blight. No, when the infection is high you see Crimson courtyard creatures everywhere, so planning party comp is less important. 

The worse thing is that it gets boring fast. Do I really want to spend hours upon hours grinding more to see the content?

In the base game I got irritated when heroes died, but in this expansion it got to the point where I didn't really care anymore because it felt I had little control, and just put heroes through a grinder. Yeah eventually you will make it through, but this is boring. You want to see content, not grind things again just to get blood or replace heroes who die from not doing what they were told.

If you are going to take agency away from the player, make it controllable on our end so that it our fault. Otherwise I won't care. Make me mad so I want to go back, not bore me with yet another: ""Oh look, another hero that died because he passed at a critical junction. Hmm... I couldn't do anything about it. Let's level up another level 5 hero again. Yay!""

The new area, minions, bosses, trinklets, classes (flagellant) are great. The content is difficult, but this is what we play DD for. 

But the loss of agency due to the crimson curse, the blood farming, etc. makes the game unfun. It makes the game grindier, which is boring. Let's call bad design for what it is - bad design, and for this reason, this DLC gets a markdown from me.",76561198031057842,0,14,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

Even if you dislike the Crimson Court concept, the DLC makes a number of strong gameplay innovations that vastly improve the base game in my opinion. Some, like the district system give the developers a lot of room to expand the feature in the future. Here are some of the reasons Crimson Court is worth your money (in my humble opinion), assuming you dislike the crimson curse system (more on that in a bit) . 

[list]
[*] District system fleshes out the lategame, forces you to make more meaningful decisions regarding heirlooms vs cash, and figuring out district buildorder can be fun. 
[*] Flagellent class is unique and refreshing. Both him and the districts can be turned on while keeping the more contraversial features turned off. Arguably worth buying for DD fans for these features alone. While I think that the Flagellent is a bit too strong compared to the characters in the base game, he does give the player more options with team comps. 
[*] Crimson Court Trinkets add more flavour and more options for the heroes. Getting a clutch set early (like the antiquarian's, which turn her into a reliable off-healer) can change the course of a playthrough. Most of these tend to be a bit too weak compared to generic trinkets in my opinion, but they are fun regardless and usually somewhat powerful early in the game. Enhance the game's replay value. 
[*] A serious challenge for players who are already good at what DD offers. The Crimson court is, as many other have pointed out, very difficult. New boss fights are genuinely gripping and scary, unlike many of the regular bosses. 
[*] The Fanatic allows for more emergent gameplay. He'll derail your runs and force you to adapt. Probably a bit too hard as he has the potential to kick the player while she/he's down. This mixes up the grindier aspects of the game, and adds more variety to your campaign. If you're like me, you may only run into him once in a campaign. 
[*] Epic quests have a lot of potential for future expansions and beating them feels satisfying.

So now lets talk about that part of the DLC that has made people most ornery. The Crimson Curse system adds a lot of good things to the way you'll play Darkest Dungeon. It's still a highly flawed system, but not as apocalypic as some users suggest. The Crimson Curse disease that your heroes can contract is a veritable annoyance. The penalties it imparts are interesting in that they forced me to rush towards Crimson Court bosses that I would have taken my time with in vanilla (beating these bosses cures your roster of the curse).This made for more interesting and challenging fights than I was used to. In general, DD is best when the player is uncomfortable and playing by the edge of their seat, which CC helps deliver.  


The Blood management is also interesting in that it provides a real loss condition to campaigns that get caught with dwindling supplies. I like being unsure of when or if I should build a Sangine Vintners district just to control the blood problem. I find that the pressure of being rushed by CC makes the game more exciting, though others may disagree with this preference. 


tldr; Crimson Court adds a lot of solid gameplay improvements that have been overlooked due to the Crimson Curse. Worth your money, but new players should keep the Courtyard feature turned off until they have a firm grasp of the game's mechanics.",76561198014368092,0,18,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

> First, I will comment, the Flagellant class is amazingly designed, if you can catch the game on sale, just buy it for the hero and various features that the DLC provides (Districts). Then just turn off the DLC's map content!

> The base game is incredibly crafted. The game is punishing and fair when you learn its mechanics. At times it can be tricky to balance the RNG with what resources you have available, but all in all, it is an amazing game. No DLCs, this game objectively provides a challenging experience and a satisfying rush when you succeed at a task, or, eventually, succeed and beat the game.

> This DLC takes away from the base game, using a carrot-on-a-stick mentality to lower the number of the highly dangerous DLC creatures (which overwrite encounter locations in the base game's areas), as most of them have the ability to give the Crimson Curse.

> The bosses, maps, and trinkets (items in the game) are decent enough, but the Crimson Curse and the Infection Level stop the players from enjoying the base game that they likely will fall in love with if given that chance.

TLDR; Curse and Infection Levels take away from the extraordinarily crafted game that Darkest Dungeons is, though the DLC itself is not inherently bad, it is also not inherently good either.",76561198048908313,0,3,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

(they should all be [spoiler]blacked[/spoiler] out)[/h1] 

TL:DR - The Crimson Court is essentially playing Darkest Dungeon with additional minor handicap of The Crimson Curse, which is fun once you learn how to manage it. Expect a learning curve similar to learning how to manage stress for the first time. New bosses and area are cool, they also added new buildings that can be contrusted and trinket pairs that become more powerful when combined as well as a new hero class that's a lot of fun to play. 

Thus far, I'm enjoying the DLC quite a bit. Before I get into the review: [u]Anyone who is having difficulties and/or frustrations with the DLC, feel free to message me for advice on how to manipulate some of the mechanics into your favor.[/u]

A few weeks after beginning a new game, you will receive your first ""Invitation"" which is an item that allows you to visit the new area called ""The Courtyard"". You begin with a tutorial introduction dungeon that is tough as nails on its own and will punish you [spoiler]if you're fool enough to enter with weak, under-leveled and under-upgraded characters[/spoiler]. A new enemy-type called ""Bloodsucker"" inhabit this land who will honor you in battle by spreading the aforementioned curse. In addition, you must also get used to handling slight alterations to how torchlight works [spoiler](a torch gives your party a 1 Battle buff, while the regular torchlight always stays in a constant state that with it's own buffs and de-buffs)[/spoiler] as well as new curios, traps and obstacles. 

After finishing the first courtyard mission, these new bloodsuckers will [spoiler]begin to spawn in surrounding dungeons[/spoiler]. Not only that, but they will quickly spread of the Crimson Curse to your heroes, which is a disease that cannot be cured in the Sanitarium and must be managed in addition of everything else you have to manage on an average quest (provisions, inventory space, health, stress,  trinkets, ratio of treasures to heirlooms... ect). This becomes an extra step you have to take to survive, including collecting a vials of what's called ""The Blood"" which works as a medicine for the curse. The Blood is found as random loot, most commonly after Bloodsucker battles. 

The Curse itself has several different stages, each one worse than the previous. Only feeding your cursed heros the blood will give them their strength back and keep them from shriveling up and dying on you. The curse acts as both a disese and an affliction by way of giving a slight but ever-present debuff (as well as a small speed buff) and in most of its stages the curse will sometimes force undesirable actions from your heroes, similar but les devestating than an affliction. 

As the Crimson Curse spreads among your heroes, the only way to cure yourself of it is to adventure into The Courtyard and kill one of inhabiting three new bosses. The catch is that these areas are unlike anything you've had to deal with up until now. The Courtyard dungeon size are of, what they call, ""Epic"" length, which can feature up to [spoiler]100 rooms with gates that require a certain colored key[/spoiler] , and minibosses to mess you up along the way. Also, the game does not provide you with firewood so you cannot camp unless you [spoiler] find firewood from one of the curios[/spoiler]. As such, bringing a party that can heal itself well, both HP and Stress is vital. 

[spoiler]The catch is that once you leave this area, you begin again in the same point on the map and when you abandon the quest. The map is not proceedurely generated either, meaning that it can be learned and mastered just like the Darkest Dungeon areas.[/spoiler]

In addition to all this madness is another boss called The Fanatic. He is a [spoiler]wandering[/spoiler] boss who is there to hunt heros afflicted with the crimson curse. The loading screen will change to a picture of him, warning you that you will have to face him at some point in the dungeon, and he is [/spoiler]no joke of a fight. I was absolutely wrecked the first time I faced him, losing two heroes and having another a death's door and one on death's doorstep. 

Helping you along the way is a new class of hero named The Flagellant. He's a frontline hero with attacks that inflict heavy bleed buildup and has interesting mechanics that buff him when he's close to death, with a powerful but situational-only healing ability as well as an ability that transfers marks, bleeds and blights from another hero onto himself. [spoiler]A party of a Vestal --> Jester --> Houndmaster/Highwayman --> Flagellant makes running around in the epic sized courtyard missions almost trivial once you know what you're up against. [/spoiler]

Also here to help you are the new trinkets sets. Each hero class has a new pair of trinkets that when equipped together give an even larger boost. For example, if you equip both of the Highwayman's new trinkets, in addition to the individual boosts from each trinket, it'll also give you a +45% virtue chance. 

Lastly, there is a new area of the Hamlet called ""The District"". The district has areas for buildings to be constructed that provide powerful buffs, but it requires A LOT of upgrade heirlooms a the new ""Blueprint"" item, which is earned by defeating Veteran or stronger bosses in addition to the one the game provides you early on. Constructing a ""Bank"" will give you an additional 5% gold on whatever money is in the hamlet when you depart for a mission. If you plan ahead and know what you want to build, it can make parts of the game much easier to compensate for the additional hardships the curse will bring you. [spoiler]Also, I noticed that with districts enabled, heirlooms seemed to drop at a larger rate.[/spoiler] 

All-in-all, I recommend the DLC to anyone wanting another layer of difficulty added into an already harsh and unforgiving game. I have read many, many negative reviews and many of the complaints reminded me of back when Darkest Dungeon first added corpses to the game. Lots of people complained because their old tactics needed adjusting and didn't fancy going through an initially painful re-learning phase. I've always found Darkest Dungeon to be best as a stressful but rewarding game the first playthrough and then a fun challenge once understood. The Courtyard, bosses, crimson curse, flagellant and districts have been a welcome addition and I can't wait for see what kinds of masochistic wonders Red Hook will bestow upon us next.

For a start, it is, in essence, a fantastic DLC. The new enemy types are interesting, the new space is well designed and stands out, the new items are interesting, the new class Is one of the best so far, and the bosses (bar 1) are amazingly designed and fun to fight.
This DLC is by nature, very invasive, which i don't mind, just so long as you have played through once. It is generally much harder than the base game content, which is very welcome after having finished the game.
My issue stands with the final boss. It is a very miserable ending to the DLC. All of the bosses in the game are interesting, with obvious habits, and often a couple of weaknesses, that you have to discover yourself by probing the boss fights with various combinations.
The final boss of this DLC is stupid. It is badly designed, as it has been made to have no weaknesses, and its original interesting habits and nature has been changed to just be obscenely powerful, start to finish.
You can't just beat this boss with the right strategy. You can use the golden combo, with all the right trinkets, all the right items, and make all the right decisions, but you will still almost always lose. You have to get lucky with crit strings to win.
The boss wasn't always this way, it was actually pretty good once, and had a weakness, that you could discover, but they patched that out.
It's such a shame that such a good DLC has such a poor ending. Otherwsie I would seriously recommend this, it is all brilliant apart from the obnoxious artificially difficult boss at the end.

The new champion is great. He can play second line tank, support, and dps depending on how you build him and has fun mechanics.

People complain that this dlc is hard and that's not really the problem. It's not hard its just incredibly intrusive. After you get one person with crimson plague they will slowly spread it to the rest of your champions even if you provide them with blood. This slowly starts to hijack your entire game as the more you have the more it spreads. Eventually you can't keep up with the blood requirement of your champions and they will slowly waste away and die.

The ONLY way to fix this is to constantly look for blood which is a random drop and use the blood you've accumulated to keep going into the crimson court in an attempt to get more. Eventually you literally can't do anything except go to the crimson court and the dungeon has something like 100~ rooms. After going into the Court 8 times in a row and having my best healer waste away I eventually disbanded more than half my entire roster of 25 down to 11 including many of my strongest champions just to get rid of the problem. Most of all my gametime was lost because of a mechanic that forced me to have to do the same thing over and over again while eventually being screwed by rng.

If you can stand running the same dungeon over and over with and not be allowed to play the rest of the game until it's done then I guess this dlc is for you. Pretty much the only way to deal with the crimson blood mechanic requires knowledge you can't have unless you either ragequit a game or lose most of your roster like I did. Basically you can't get crimson plague until your near endgame levels of strength which is tricky when the things that spread it start appearing in every dungeon. Yes you can ignore the things that spawn the enemies but if the best way to interact with a dlc is to ignore it for most of the game that's not a good thing.",76561198031562197,0,1,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

  The best part of the new mission is the flagellent class.  It's possibly a little too strong when not in a dungeon full of bleed resistent enemies, but he's thematically cool and fun to play.  

  The rest is mostly bad.  The DLC adds vampirism, which somewhat unavoidably will spread among your crew and put them in a state where they require regular infusions of a blood loot drop to keep going, even when not questing.  The game pressures you to start the DLC plotline by immosing town-wide stress reduction penalties until you kick off the quest chain, and then starts spawning vampiric enemies in every mission with increasing frequency if you don't clear the quest chain bosses in a timely fashion.

  The vampirism itself isn't quite as scary as it might first seem.  Passive blood drops alone will keep alive several heroes who you aren't adventuring with regularly, without requiring you to run the mission that lets you grind for blood.  In fact, when you first get someone you care about infected you might be tempted to run on the blood cellar quest to get some blood as a buffer against losing them, but this is a trap: you don't need to, and running the mission with a mostly non-vampiric party will just leave you stuck with more vampires to feed.

  After some initial fear that I was going to lose my infected star heroes because they happened to get hit by a bite attack, I started to like The Crimson Court.  The blood mechanic is more bark than bite, and nicely adds an atmosphere of stress and doom to the game.  Then, however, I started discovering the epic dungeons and how the vampirism impacts the economy.

  The epic dungeons themselves are the worst.  They're required to reset the progress of the vampire plague and eventually reduce it to the status of a normal disease.  However, they're a giant maze that you're expected to complete across multiple sessions and start at veteran level so you need to send in skilled heroes to progress- and fairly tough, as well.  So, you send in a bunch of skilled troops and play until you're chewed up, quit and suffer additional negative traits and stress for ""losing"", and don't get a completion reward so you're forced to grind money to get them back up into fighting state again.  Grind the dungeon, grind for coins to recover, repeat.  Darkest Dungeon is designed around attrition and tough financial decisions, but this is painful and pointless.

  Compounding this is the way the vampire plague impacts with the low level economy.  When things get rough in Darkest Dungeon, you may find yourself in the position of taking a bunch of free heroes off the stagecoach and running an easy mission for money.  That's an essential part of the game- it both trains up a back roster of heroes to help you replace unfortunate losses in the higher ranks of your roster, and acts as a path to recovery when things go bad.

  Vampirism partially breaks this.  You can still do it, but instead of just as a recovery mechanic or roster-building mechanic you'll probably find yourself doing it just to grind gold to fund your anti-vampirism crusade, which is a lot less fun.  Furthermore, these runs become a lot less rewarding on two fronts.  First, the appearance of the vampiric enemies in easy missions can increase the difficulty of the missions somewhat in some environs, meaning you're more likely to fail these missions and get less monetary payoff for your grind.  Secondly, the vampiric minions will infect some of your newbies with vampirism, which means you'll want to keep fewer of them because some of them will start competing with the heroes you care about for blood.  This means you also get less of a roster-building payout as well.

  You'll have to do fresh-off-the-coach runs more frequently, for less enjoyable reasons, and with less payoff for your grind time.

  The you-might-become-a-vampire factor also means more turnover in your mid-tier roster and that you'll be fielding your built-up but infected heroes less to reduce their blood comsumption, but this is at least a mostly manageable onus.

  On top of this there's the wandering vampire-hunter boss, which adds a random difficulty spike to missions and further punishes you for not just sidelining your characters when they get infected.  Both bad ideas, although at least he also can drop a cure which acts as a stabilizing factor against getting stuck with too many vampires in your roster.

  As a final flaw regarding Vampirism, just a matter of bad UI design rather than mechanical issues, the Provisions screen doesn't warn you if you're about to enter a dungeon with vampiric characters and no blood to feed them.  Expect to enter a dungeon and immediately realized that your run's a bust because you've got a lot of starving and heavily penalized vampires, and the game's already autosaved behind you.  This is inexcusable.

  Vampirism just doesn't work for Darkest Dungeon as implemented.  The Epic Dungeon idea needs to be abandoned entirely.  For Vampirism in general to work, it needs to be excluded from starter missions, which would probably mean reworking the tiers so that you had four or five semi-overlapping mission tiers where the first tier was renown 0-1 and had 
no vampiric enemies.   As it is, the variety provided by the new location and enemies, plus the small amount of additional strategic depth added are absolutely not worth the amount of repetion and grind they add.

  The Crimson Court also adds ""districts"" which are a big estate material sink to get persistent bonuses, which seems like it would be a fine addition as a handout to let players struggling with the game eventually grind past it to beat it but doesn't seem like it has much of a place in the game otherwise.

  Overall, The Crimson Court has some neat ideas but makes you spend a lot of time treading water for little additional fun.  I would not recommend it.",76561197961372576,0,37,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

I play on Radiant, I enjoy this game for a nice bit of dungeon crawling, I've spent 20 hours on it in the past week and I've lost a couple of high-level parties to challenging bosses. I'm really digging this game that way.
This DLC is obnoxious.
The mechanics introduced in this new parts of the game can be summed up as follow. Enemies from the new zone, the Courtyard, have a chance to make your characters crave blood ; these enemies sometimes spawn in other dungeons, so chances are you'll encounter them one way or another ; the blood curse spreads fairly easily from their attacks, or between your heroes whenever they share a treatment building ; its effects range in inconvenience from an incurable disease to a permanent affliction ; you cannot cure the curse before finishing the DLC ; the DLC missions are designed in such a way that you won't be able to finish in one go, with only random firewood and upwards of a hundred rooms ; you need a randomly dropped item to either start or continue one of these quests ; you still get stress penalty from going back to the hamlet if you want to take a break from such missions.
Installing this DLC will basically transform your heroes into coke addicts that constantly ramble and shit blood until your whole party dies of a heart attack in a joyless, hour long dungeon because of the increasingly high debuffs of the curse you're here to satiate, using randomly dropped items.

This review of course does not apply to anyone seeking a challenging experience, I'm sure they'll get a kick out of it. For the rest of us I'd suggest you avoid this DLC.",76561198018329687,0,12,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

The Crimson Curse is the most notable mechanic introduced in The Crimson Court. It is a permanent infection that characters always risk getting, even if they do not go to the new Court area. The curse weakens characters, makes them behave erratic, stresses everyone else, makes them attack their allies, and ultimately kills the afflicted, that is if you do not feed them The Blood, a droppable item that never goddamn drops. So instead, you keep your characters separate from the Crimson Cursed ones, and hope you never encounter the new enemies that DLC introduces! Game design has to be pretty fundamentally broken if you dearly wish not to see its content.

If this gets fixed somehow, like, it becomes rarer to get afflicted, or The Blood drops more frequently so you can do a damn thing about the Curse, I would recommend the game.

What really bothers me here is something else...
Before the DLC, every location had its own atmosphere : You had the ruins with its skeletons and heretics, the cove with its fishmen and crustaceans, the weald with its filthy pigs.

But once you activate the DLC and get a bit into it, every single location is filled with mosquito people (around half of the fights), to the point that diversity is almost completely lost.

Well, only the toughest of the tough has what it takes to handle the court. It is not ""just"" more content, it is more difficulty, more frustration, more pain, death and anger too. The Crimson Court is a dlc that takes a game that, for some, is already difficult and unfair and cranks it up to eleven; this makes a difficult game much more difficult in every way. 

So let it be clear from the start:
IF YOU HAVE NOT BEATEN THE ORIGINAL GAME AND ARE COMFORTABLE WITH IT, THE CRIMSON COURT IS GOING TO BLEED YOU OUT AND LEAVE AN EMPTY HUSK.

This DLC is not something you can sequester off in a normal run; if you start a game with the Crimson Court active, then it will make sure to intrude on any other plan you have. 
In the normal game, you have to handle a few ""macro resources"" throughout your run: 
-gold
-character exp spread
-heirlooms
The Crimson Court adds another element that needs to be handled, which puts much more strain on your party builds and your hamlet management. In addition, it introduces new enemies that are just as deadly as the horrors you already know. Both of these things contribute to the difficulty; it is much more than a new zone, a new subplot and some new enemies.

This is a dlc that really delivers ""more"" darkest dungeon, in every sense of the word, not just more enemies and locations, but more of all the difficulties in hamlet management, inventory space prioritization, caring for heroes and, of course, deadly horrors out for your blood and sanity. This is a dlc only for those who want to push themselves to the limit, and then surpass it. 

I like it, but I would say it is borderline necessary that you have beaten the game at least once before touching it. 

A personal thing I love about this dlc though: the concept of vampires have been revamped (heh) to perfection here. Instead of bats, they are based on mosquitos , and a humming omnious dinn can be heard in the relevant zone. The enemies here are so original and have so much identity.

So please, if you consider yourself skilled at darkest dungeon and happen to be slightly maladjusted... come and join us in the court. I will reserve you a seat by the Countess's table; I promise it will be an occation to die for...

I highly recommend NOT buying it, even if it's on sale as the developers basically got high and forgot why people loved the base game they made. They thankfully sobered up and corrected their drastic mistake with the Color of Madness DLC, which I more or less recommend, but this is a complete and total disaster. All the developers did is get their sadist buddies in a room and listened to feedback about how to make this game the most annoying pile of crap on the Internet. They succeeded admirably!

So as early as week five the game forces the Crimson Court content down your throat by introducing a permanent town event that cannot be removed until you defeat the first Crimson Court mission. This event prevents any other town event from spawning and decreases the effectiveness of every stress relief offered in town. The ""apprentice"" mission the game wants you to defeat is misleading and is in all actuality not recommended to do until you are ready for veteran tier missions. 

So now you've done this stupid mission but do you get any relief? No, of course not, the ""mission timer gymnastics"" have just begun! Now extremely boring ""bloodsucker"" enemies attack you in EVERY mission in EVERY part of the manor, giving most of your heroes the Crimson Curse, which is generally speaking a debilitating disease that can eventually kill you that you cannot remove until you complete more Crimson Court missions, go figure. These bloodsucking enemies will sometimes constitute half or more of the encounters you face regardless of where you are, so they get really boring really quick. But of course the fun doesn't end there! As an added bonus, half of the curios you could have benefited from end up becoming ""Throbbing Cocoons"" instead, which essentially provide no benefit at all and should be completely ignored. 

And of course that's not annoying enough; very soon the game releases ""The Fanatic"", a completely balanced three actions per turn boss which has a chance to endlessly spawn on EVERY non-boss mission if you bring a cursed hero with you. The Fanatic really is only vulnerable to bleeds and armor piercing and since he functions like the Hag you essentially only have three heroes to kill him. So the game threaten this stupid boss with painfully few weaknesses every single mission.

Almost all of the trinkets introduced in this game are worthless because all they do is ""improve"" the Crimson Curse, which is something you generally speaking want to remove ASAP all the time. Even the best ones are frankly outclassed by other trinkets that already exist in the base game except in the most specific circumstances.

Terminal crack addicts at that, if they don't get their fix, which will be needed about every few weeks.

This is the Crimson Court's most notable feature: A brand new permanent debuff that can't be cured in the Sanatorium and will eventually kill the afflected hero unless their addiction for an item called ""The Blood"" is constantly met. Seems oppressive, but that's the general atmosphere of the Darkest Dungeon already so I'm not sure what I expected.

How ""fun"" this is depends on a number of factors: Does the Curse have any strategic benefit (is it strictly a negative), how easy is it to get the Curse, and how easy is it to get ""The Blood"" to prevent your heroes from dying?

The answer is mostly not, very, and not very.

Even if you choose to ignore the Crimson Court the enemies in that zone that cause The Curse will start to show up in increasing numbers in other zones. Eventually you will get the Curse. The hero will need an item called ""The Blood"" to prevent the from dying, and they'll need it every 3-4 weeks. If you have a roster of 10 people that get Cursed that's about 3 Bloods every week.

Blood is a random loot pickup and in standard dungeons is not plentiful. Thankfully there are dedicated Blood run missions in the Court which can help stock your inventory, but inventory management was already a pain before the Crimson Court and this only makes it worse.

With that out of the way we can discuss the rest of the content. It's mostly good. Instead of Medium sized dungeons the Crimson Court levels are all massive and non-randomized. They actually take multiple entries to explore. This is going to be up to personal preference, but I found it a bit exhausting. Long dungeons already were troublesome since you can't bring back all the loot you'd like, and sadly inventory management or space has not been changed at all. I found myself having to leave the dungeon not because my heroes were too stresses, but because my bags were full.

By far the best feature of the Crimson Court is the best part of Darkest Dungeon in general: Art design. The monsters are all fallen dilettantes and aristocrats that have mutated into bloodsucking parasites and insects, and are barely able to disguise their previous human forms. The metaphor is obvious and brilliant all at the same time. I've never seen a grotesque beetle wear a powdered wig before and it's awesome to behold.

There are some trinkets, which are mostly bad. But the new class The Flagellant, has a unique playstyle that's somehow different from the other 16. He is a lot of fun to use despite being nerfed in the last patch.

So we have a mixed bag. I still think there's enough content here to be worth getting. The Curse is not a fun mechanic (and there's no escaping it), inventory management is even worse now, but the new class and monsters are very good.",76561197967459119,350,155,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

I do have faith that at some point Red Hook will patch out a lot of the probelms, but it's currently flat out not very good. The Crimson Curse mechanic is straight bad and the worst kind of video game artificial difficulty increase, there's really no way around this. It weakens your characters to literally no appreciable gain, can kill characters (there is a 0% chance they don't add a difficulty toggle for this later, so why isn't it there at release?), and worst of all can cost you control of your characters. It's totally unfun to work with.

The new dungeon content seems okay, but it's impossible to access more than the first mission, so it's hard to tell. You need Blood to drop, it doesn't. You need invitations to drop, they don't. So I can't even evaluate the new dungeons past the first one.

The new district system is a fine idea but the heirloom costs to build them are completely ridiculous, so they are 100% irrelivant until very late game/post-Darkest Dungeon for the most part.

The new class, the Flagelant, is great. I think he's a very creative idea and enjoyable to use. Like the Leper, he is not good at all if he gets shuffled from the front rows so I think he's fairer than some realize.

Overall this is a DLC of wonderful ideas but the execution of the Crimson Curse and the associated dungeon content is so bad that until changes are made, there's no way to upthumb this with a straight face.

If/when this DLC gets some tweaking and attention, I will alter this review to reflect it.

(EDIT: JUNE 26)
We've had about a week to play the new content now so reviews are actually starting to become relevant and we're out of the ""upthumb content I haven't actually played"" phase. And really, I'm pretty confident in not recommending this right now. There's been a hotfix that makes Blood/Invitations (key plot items) drop more often. But this DLC still suffers from some pretty serious problems that make the game genuinely worse. The Crimson Curse is just not fun at all, and the new content is extremely grindy. The infestation system is also, frankly, quite bad. It time-gates progress for no reason, and on top of that it disrupts the game's balance. Once infestation gets high, a third to nearly half of all enemies are replaced by DLC content. This really screws up a huge number of traditional DD parties that are now marginalized in the extreme and totally breaks game balance and enemy variety, one of the things that made DD interesting to begin with.

This is a really bad DLC in a game I once loved a lot. I'm pretty confident saying Crimson Court is a module that if I do play Darkest Dungeon again, I will be turning it off and leaving it off. I'm clearly not alone, judging by recent feedback. As it stands, this is my single biggest disappointment in gaming in 2017.",76561198052610539,815,134,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

The crimson curse mechanic essentially removes Heroes from your Roster while they have it, which happens extremely quickly. Enemies that have a 30% chance to inflict it commonly spawn in random encounters (Syncopants) in packs of two, with a speed rating of 10 (which is way more than any non-endgame hero will have), and if you're unlucky, both will inflict the crimson curse on different heroes in your party in the first two actions of combat before you have any chance at counterplay. Once they have the crimson curse, they are debuffed for around 50% of your entire save state or game run, and risk infecting other heroes if they even share the same building in a stress relieving activity (you know, the ones you regularly use to counteract the main game mechanic of stress?). 

Apart from that, Red Hook introduced a new kind of ridiculously strong random boss (like the Shrieker or the Collector), the Fanatic. Imagine a Hag on crack. He also has a couldron, only it's a stake, and he removes heroes from your roster. Sounds not too bad, right? Well, where the Hag has two actions per turn, he has three. Where the Hag has a total of 4 abilities, he has 5. Where the Hag has anywhere between 0-27 Dodge and no PROT, the Fanatic has 3-25 Dodge, and 15 PROT - which he often buffs through abilities that still deal large damage to up to 65 PROT. Remember, during this, he still has 3 actions and you only have 3 heroes. And the best part? You can't even prepare for him! The Hag you know you'll face because you select the mission. You know you'll face the Fanatic because the game tells you in the loading screen (so after you've assembled your party) - and at that point you can essentially abandon the quest. You got a marking party? Too bad, the mark is gone after one round because he has three actions. Speed-based party? One of this attacks inflicts a -3 speed debuff. He takes your Healer to the stake first? You're fucked. He takes your back-rank damage dealer? Also fucked, as characters are released from the stake in rank 1.  Apart from that he has a high-percentage stun which also deals high damage, inflicts stress, and moves the target back (effectively leaving you with 2 heroes for the turn). He is no fun to play against unfortunately - he is not challenging, just plain unfair. Against any other boss you can determine their weaknesses and create a party accordingly, you can prepare and plan, and if you're unlucky, you might still get fucked - that's Darkest Dungeon. But with him, you can't prepare, you can't plan ahead, he is a random encounter and he will fuck your party. A randomly appearing boss that is worlds stronger than an actual boss in the game (yes you can avoid him by not using crimson cursed heroes - but at some point in the game so many heroes have the curse that this is impossible to avoid).

People will say git gud, or that I'm obviously not the target audience for this game, or any kind of bs ""look at me I'm so tough"" excuse because they never had anything anyone was ever proud of them for - but honestly, if I'm voluntarily disabling content I PAID FOR because it is so unfun, that's a line to me.

I really like the new class, the Districts and the lore-related trinkets, and I don't mind managing cursed heroes with blood. Blood is easy to come about. Here's what bothers me, starting from THE most annoying thing:

-There is simply not enough variety of vampire enemies. After some time ignoring the DLC missions, the regular missions become overrun with the same old vampire enemies. You get super tired of fighting them over and over, to the point where the regular enemies become a novelty. I know this is supposed to motivate you into completing the DLC missions, but as of now it just makes the game a lot more repetitive. And on top of all that the new enemies are strong as hell.

- The DLC missions are obnoxiously long, to the point of ridiculousness. With limited inventory space and enemies dealing a crapton of stress damage, there is simply no reason to explore them to their full extent. You just want the missions to end, which equals to these missions being a chore. The bosses (up to the Viscount at least) aren't even that hard, the real ""challenge"" is pushing yourself to get to them. 

- The curse is the worst debuff there is in this game. Characters under 100 stress refusing healing and dying from it is just retarded, no other word for it. I realize it's a ""curse"", but the cons far outweight the pros of having vampires in your party, which defeats the purpose of the curse being a ""double-edged knife"".

Short version: Like the core game? Crimson court is alright and more of the game.

Long Version: Ho boy here we go, into the fray of split opinions. time to tackle this issue by issue.

1) The Court Quests. Let's just get this out of the way. First, I agree, the court quests are long and super grindy and take effort to complete. It's almost like the Darkest Dungeon itself in that way, leveling heros to send them to thier likely death. Somehow I still enjoyed them though. If you read my previous review on the core game you know to experiment with curios, super important in the courtyard. For the longest time I tried to figure out it's purpose. You send heroes in knowing that they are probably going to die or get infected but that's life. Then it dawned on me after a run on my PS4 litterly right before this review. I got a ton of heirlooms, like a stupid amount. Then I saw one of it's purposes, a consistent, somewhat predictable but also finite loot run. I'll get into it's second use later.

2) The Curse Itself. A virulent disease that easily spreads from hero to hero, or monster to hero. I heard recently that this was rebalanced but I'm operating off of PS4 information. If there is one chess game in Darkest Dungeon that I know about, it's quirk/disease balancing, or using. With use of the curse you can turn a damge hero into a wave of destruction, but this aspect is almost useless on a healer, minus the potential speed buff. This is where the quests come in. Upon completion, you get the ability to cure the curse, or control it. This means you can get your leper infected and use him as a sleeping giant to kill the next boss that looks at you funny. It's control over a tool in the game.

3) The Flagelant. Super cool idea of a class that you want to almost kill just so you can fling that damage right back at that irritating nasty. Nothing much else to say except that he's a welcome addition to the roster.

4) The Fanatic. I only fought this guy once and got wiped. I was irritated but he was such a fun and disturbed boss that I look forward to fighting him again. Well designed mechanics too.

5) The Districts. These are really clever too. I initially thought that these would take forever to complete but I got the ones I really wanted fairly quickly. The heirloom trade really helps with that.

Anyway, this may be too hard for a first playthrough, but I made it just fine despite the inconveniences.

Three major things are added : the Courtyard, the Flagellant, and Districts. You can toggle each of them on and off, so I'd still very much recommend buying it and just toggling the Courtyard (so the part that causes the problems that resulted in all these negative reviews) and activating the others.

Because this DLC may add very nasty stuff that made a lot of people angry, but it also adds a lot of OP stuff to make up for it, which you see mentioned a lot less strangely enough. All in all, I see it as a ""bad"" design decision that I'm glad they've made, using Tyler Sigman's words, co-funder of Red Hook himself.

The Flagellant is a new class. He's also my favorite. He's also broken as shit. Sure, bringing a Flagellant along won't make any dungeon a cakewalk, but he is one goddamn strong addition to your party, and shines everywhere except the ruins. Basically, he makes things bleed a LOT, and if he goes below 50% HP he has the choice between either healing 50% of his HP (at max level, 33% at lowest) and inflicting massive bleed damage upon one enemy, or healing both himself and one teammate 50% (or 33 at lowest, again) of their HP. Add above average stats to the mix and a lot of other powerful stuff and you end up with a dude capable of clearing dungeons and bosses by himself. (Yeah. Look it up)

The Districts are basically endgame, huge bonuses you can buy with artifacts and a bit of gold. Most notably, the Bank, which is not that expensive and basically gives you 5% of your total money each week. You may not realize how well this can snowball, but you'll end up with hundreds of thousands of gold really fast, if not millions. It essentially removes gold farming from the game. Thaaaat's pretty strong.

That's the OP stuff. Now for the star of the show, the Courtyard.
As early as Week 10 or so, you'll be asked to visit the Courtyard. If you refuse, you'll suffer from reduced stress healing in town (and no town events) as long as you don't visit it, and if you do, you'll trigger the **Crimson Curse**, which has caused many tears and many ragequits. 
Courtyard missions, other than the very first, simpler one, are exceptionally long dungeons with a boss at the end, which you are expected to do in several tries, since you restart them from where you stopped during the last one. The new enemies and bosses are absolutely amazing, the third boss in particular blew my mind by how amazing her design was. However, the enemies, bosses and missions themselves are really tough, and are not to be taken lightly.
But the real nasty part isn't the missions, it's the **Crimson Curse**. Basically, Courtyard enemies have a small chance to give you the **Crimson Curse**, which gives minor debuffs and acts as a lesser affliction when the hero is either craving blood, or in blood-lust state. For every so often (usually once or twice per dungeon in a medium one), your hero will crave blood, a new resource you can find scattered around. Giving it to them will give them slight buffs and cause you to lose control of them sometimes, same thing when they're craving minus the buffs. All in all, it's annoying.
The real kicker is that Courtyard enemies can spawn in *any* dungeon after a while. Even worse, they can replace so many of the local enemies your fights will be 50% (or more) Courtyard enemies sometimes, while you'd expect the Warrens to have, you know, PIG DUDES. And they can give you the Crimson Curse. So yeaaaah, you end up having a good chunk of your roster with a permanent lesser affliction.
Although all your roster is cured as soon as you beat a Crimson Court boss, and the **Crimson Curse** becomes a curable disease when you beat the final Courtyard boss.
So you have a DLC that forces itself upon you, changes the whole game around, and gives everyone annoying permanent afflictions.

It's amazing. Best purchase in a while. Just deactivate the Courtyard if you don't feel up to it. Hell, I activated it during my first playthrough, and I did fine, so it's not as bad as people make it out to be. Just buy it.",76561198089544813,385,14,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

When a hero is cursed, they have to consume blood, which is a random drop (and hence you can run out if you get unlucky), or they eventually die. Further, the hero loses 10% max hp, a bunch of resists, and will randomly pass their turn, cause party-wide stress damage, or attack friendlies. This is permanent. 

The new enemies inflict this permanent, crippling debuff at a ridiculous rate. You can expect to get cursed every 2 or 3 encounters with the new enemies,  which are not restricted to the new area, but appear in every other area. An expedition to the new area will surely curse your entire party. The encounters seem designed to guarantee that you will be cursed: level 1 encounters are typically two stun-immune enemies with too much hp to consistently one-shot and two enemies with 11 speed. 

If you go into an expedition with 4 cursed characters, there is a 99% chance of an extremely difficult encounter boss, named the Fanatic, spawning. I'm at a point where it feels like I simply can't put together a party that can both clear an expedition and kill the Fanatic, while my dwindling supply of blood means that very soon my cursed heroes will simply start dying off. And there's nothing I can do about it! There is no counterplay to avoid being cursed in the first place, and no strategy to obtain blood reliably if you are running out. 

This is supposed to be a game that's about preparation, but you are utterly helpless to deal with the curse. It's simply not fun.

Update:
I received quite a bit of negative feedback over this review, and after several balancing patches came out, I tried this DLC again. 

In spite of multiple patches increasing the drop rate of blood, and dismissing lower-level heroes with the curse, I lost a level 4 hero to the curse and now have two more level 4 heroes in the ""wasting"" state (they will automatically die if left in town, and have a random chance to instantly die if you take them on an expedition) and no blood remaining. I counted, and my last SEVEN encounters with bloodsuckers dropped zero blood. 

When your hero dies from the curse, there's no death's door check, or any other mitigating mechanic, unless you risk bringing them on the expedition with you. So effectively my other two level 4 heroes are also dead, and there is nothing I can do about it unless I gamble and bring them to the courtyard. Of course, if they hit a blood check, which occur randomly and without warning, they will die on the expedition and then I face the standard problems of being on an expedition with two dead characters. And I am STILL powerless to do anything about it. I'm going to lose quite a bit of progress because of this awful, poorly-thought-out mechanic. It's the opposite of fun.

Most frustrating is the artificial gate to the new area: Invitations, which only drop after a significant amount of grinding, in an already somewhat grindy game. 

Furthermore, the signposting the DLC provides early on leads newbies to an area that is significantly harder than the game's text indicates - putting a poor taste in the mouth of those just starting out. God forbid those people are in the two-hour refund window.

I enjoyed playing and saw a lot of promise in the new hero class introduced. If you stew on it, there are some interesting strategies that you can employ while using the Flagellant hero. I only realized a few of them near the end of my play-through.

The story and the narration are top notch just like in the base game.

Having played the base game, I expected there to be some grind present but, not this much. It took me about 15-20 hours to beat 8-10 hours of content.

Before you do that, you have to collect invitations to the Courtyard from the other dungeons in the region. This is only possible once there is an acceptable level of Crimson Curse in the hamlet which resets each time you defeat a boss. On top of all that, the Courtyard dungeons are super long mazes in a similar vein to the final dungeon in the base game. 

I'm going to recommend this DLC only for the people who absolutely love the Darkest Dungeon. Although this DLC has a great story, setting, and additional hero class, it has a lack of respect for the player's time. Pacing in games is very important to me.

-Short: New Dungeon, mechanics, trinkets, enemies, events and a new class:Flagellant. Very hard if you don't know what you're doing with a tough dungeon mechanic and Crimsons Curse. Flagellant is a risky but fun bleed dps and healer. 8/10.

-Long: This has a lot of mixed reviews from people saying this is too hard, which admittedly it is, but its more of a challenge than a unfair experience. 
     Crimson Court is a whole new dungeon/region to go to every week. It has sort of a vampire noble story line but with the twist its more like bloodsucking insects like mosquitoes and leeches than bats. New enemies, once you attend the court once, can be found in every other region too in the form of a cocoon curio (which you have the option to ignore... but the loot!) Some of the enemies can be excruciatingly annoying to deal with as they are numerous and are dodgy (you will hate the mosquitoes a lot) not to mention they can easily stress bomb you if RNG demands it. Also, the boss battles can be REALLY tough if you're not prepared. Still, the point is to die and come back with what you learned. More fools come to the Hamlet everyday, so don't be afraid to throw bodies at the problem.

     Crimson Curse is a new mechanic added that is very annoying to deal with, but before I go on you can get mods that disable it, which doesn't stop any content but the Fanatic roaming boss (which is ok cause he is tough anyway). Crimson Curse has a chance of spreading from CC curios, their enemies' attacks, and even from already infected individuals in the Hamlet. It's basically vampirism, and gives some benefits if sated through a new item, The Blood, but for the most part is a drawback, as they constantly cause stress and sometimes attack friends and foes alike. The worst part is that heroes can die if not given The Blood after awhile and it isn't easily cured; only way to do it is killing a CC boss, a random event can cure it too or looting a fanatic, and the only way to cure in the hospital is to defeat the final CC boss, which will take awhile. Its annoying yet adds a layer of challenge if you are not afraid to meet it.

     -Flagellant-the new class: Flagellant is a unique hero as the get powerful the more damage and stress the recieve. Their moves consist of VERY powerful bleed attacks, heals that harm him, and powerful self or team heals when his low. He wants to be hurt and is best when he can take the brunt of the damage, which he will, trust me. If he gets 100 stress, he actually gets a unique effect of never virtuing but instead gets a unique affliction. It makes him very powerful yet is still an affliction so he can be a hindrance if RNG has a say. Hes is very good in dungeons that have low bleed protection (warrens, weald, CC) but really struggles to damage against something like skeletons who got no blood to bleed. A very good class but not too versatile. 7/10

     -Other things: new trinkets have been added that are actually meant to be taken as pairs. These are trinkets that tie into the character's lore/past and is usually involving a traumatic event(mostly) and usually have pretty powerful effects. Thier catch is that if you equip 2 on the same class, they usually activate a secondary effect for it's set bonus and can be game changing. Highly sought after in late game.

       Overall, it has its quirks and isn't perfect. However, I think it has become such a staple and needed addition that I can't see the game anymore without it.  8/10",76561198043431643,409,46,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

I love the new enemies. The Crimson Curse is a unique and dreadful take on a very, very old myth - the vampire. The court itself has beautiful and terrifying backgrounds, curios, and designs. Incorporating the court into a normal game creates an interesting challenge. The new champion type is very fitting for the setting, and has interesting skills and abilities. The new boss fights and enemies are well-designed, challenging, and range from bothersome to frightening.

So why don't I like this expansion?

The whole, in this instance, is much less than the sum of its parts, and it mostly comes down to level design. In order to defeat the challenges of the Crimson Court, one must venture into the court and defeat its boss monsters. Sound familiar? It should. That's the same formula for the rest of the game, one that works. But they made a huge mistake.

Firstly, the bosses are in defined maps that never change, and they are very, very large, sprawling maps. They make the DD3 mission look rather small in comparison. Unfortunately, there's also no firewood given to you for any of these maps - while it's possible to loot some, that's never enough to get through the whole map in one go-through. The progress of each party is saved though, so it seems at least that part was anticipated. Unfortunately, that's not enough.

Each of these maps will take multiple attempts to clear. So the first few ventures, perhaps event the first eight or ten ventures in the larger maps, they will all fail. That means no resolve XP is awarded for them. They're very high-level maps (almost universally intended for max level heroes) so you're risking your high-level heroes for no reward. In addition, if you run out of high level heroes (very possible due to the very lethal nature of the court and its bosses), you'll have to level up more of them outside of the court. The new updates to the coach help, but you can never throw fresh heroes into these missions and hope to accomplish anything. So the new missions suck up all your resources and drain you dry, giving precious little in return.

What's even worse, they are very large and have locked doors with color-coded keys. So you spend a lot of your time simply walking from one end of the map to the other. Have I mentioned they're huge maps? They're huge, with tons and tons of dead space. Be prepared to spend a large amount of time just walking into dead space with nothing actually happening.

I was very disappointed, because everything else about the DLC was great. If they had just made the Court a regular dungeon like the Cove or the Weald, I'd have happily recommended it to you.",76561198019431008,0,24,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

After all, any dark dungeon worthy of that name has to have bloodsucking creatures.

The design of the “vampires” is interesting: not your standard vampires and certainly not vampires that sparkle in the sun but more like parasites. You will face mosquitos and ticks and hybrids between these and humans which are dressed like 17th century nobles. Everytime these creatures bite your heroes, there is a chance that they become infected with the crimson curse and that means that they will start craving blood.

And so, you will have to gather the blood by either completing a gathering mission, finding the blood as loot or building a new district in your hamlet. 

The new districts are something to look forward to as they do add extra benefits e.g. the bank adds a 5% interest on stored gold every week. However, they are expensive and will require a lot of money and deeds/crests in order to be built. Also, you will need blueprints which will only drop from either the CC bosses or the vanilla bosses at higher levels so, no blueprints from low level bosses. One blueprint will be given for free as a town event. This will result in most of the new buildings to be built only later on once you have a more gold and higher level heroes.

Personally, I believe that these new building are not essential; I only built the vinters building for the extra blood production and the bank.

The new mechanic brought by having afflicted heroes can be tedious: you will have to manage your blood which, luckily enough, is rather easy to get but, should you have too many heroes with the curse, it will become a game of balancing normal quests and gathering blood quests. 

Which brings me to the new wandering boss: the fanatic. I like the idea of having a wandering boss actively hunting down your afflicted heroes but, especially at the beginning, this boss can be very hard to defeat and it can be frustrating to lose a party member due to a boss that can feel overpowered. However, like any other boss in DD, it's easy once you know how.

The new dungeon i.e. The Courtyard is both good and bad. It's a huge place and it is not meant to be explored in one go. The positive side is that you can leave at any time and you can restart from where you left but, as a negative, there are quite a few hard encounters which can wreck your day if you just charge in.

I did find it tedious at times to simply go in to explore and map out the whole level also considering that, in order to enter, you will need “invitations” which will only drop from the new enemies that you will encounter in the original dungeons and this is what annoyed me the most as, every time you enter the courtyard, you will use one invitation, even if you do not kill the boss. But, so far, I've managed to find quite a few of those but I do not like the idea of limiting access to a dungeon, considering also its size.

The new class, the flagellant, is good and can feel more powerful than the other classes when dealing with enemies that bleed and you will have access to him fairly soon. Some of his abilities seem to be too good but, considering the new difficulty spikes, it's a fair trade off.

So, is it bad? Is it good? As per DD, it is not for everyone and some of the mechanics can be annoying but overall it is a good DLC that will hopefully, sate your thirst for blood.",76561198003430076,0,17,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

The new dungeons are not random anymore. Wich could be ok i guess, if there were a lotofthem . But there are not and you just get the feeling that there is nothing to explore and somehow it makes the game feel stale.
To actually play the second dungeon of the crimson course, you have to farm items that randomly spawn from random encounters in the old dungeons... yeah, it plays as annoying as it sounds.

I am really wondering how they were able to come up with such a disappointing DLC, after they had such a great start with the game.

Flagellant is an ugly version of my boyfriend (at the time of writing), and just so happens to be an extremely fun and versatile class... 10/10
Districts are something to do with all the extra stuff you have, and the effects make things a little ""nicer"" in such an otherwise cruel and unforgiving game.

Important Edit: You can turn the Crimson Court Campaign, Flagellant Class, and Districts on or off individually at any time. Again reinforcing why this can still get a thumbs up despite the core content.

The campaign itself... well, eh... I'm glad it's not as bad as it was on release, but wow. The campaign constantly screams at you to pay attention to it, or else. If you start a game with the campaign enabled, you'll be swarmed every week with a stress recovery debuff, meaning you're going to have a roster full of increasingly stressed out idiots that you're just not going to be able to quell. It'd be fine if the swarm event started spamming itself when you should be able to start the content, but it happens while your roster is full of 0s and a few 1s.
Believe me, you can't just walk in there with your 0s and 1s, they'll be eaten alive by the lovely Crocodilian you'll see some people crying about (and yes, it really is as unenjoyable to fight as most people make it out to be), so you're going to be seeing ""The Town is Abuzz"" over and over... and over... and over... for a fair while as you build up a team ready to shut the damn thing up.

But oh, once you go shut the event up, and finally you have some (relative) peace in the Hamlet, now your entire game is infected. Have fun!

One of the very many charms of Darkest Dungeon is how heroes who go crazy, tend to at least have lines suited to their class or role. But the curse...? No, the curse's script is just lazy (no way to sugarcoat this, it is lazy).
The same small set of lines for each and every character... yes, shut the hell up, I've read that line 50 times already - in the current playsession. The Crimson Curse basically possesses your characters with the personality of the exact same teenage vampire edgelord. I can't imagine how frustrating it used to be on release, what with the 1/3 chance of infection creating an army for this one edgy dumbass to speak through, because I was bored of the curse within a couple of hours at most.

Aside from that, it's a welcome change to have some huge dungeons you can come and go from as you please (people complaining about no camping aren't making any sense - being able to go back home renders camping pointless, and even then there's still a way to camp if you experiment with the new curios), and the bosses are interesting.
The Countess is a nightmare and puts the Darkest Dungeon itself to shame, but still beatable.

The enemies are okay and varying degrees of just the right amount of annoying... only complaint is with the Chevalier.
Chevalier should really be a Size 2 with a little more health (his sprites are clearly Size 2, but for some reason they have him clipping horribly with surrounding enemies in a single slot). Oh yeah... those big Chevalier bugs are going to be the main cause for deaths to this content. Have fun!

New trinkets are a mixed bag, and appear to be infamously bad overall according to the community.
The first trinkets I got were the Vial of Sand and Glass Shard, so of course I thought they looked decent at first, but that was just me being lucky and getting two of the only good ones of the lot... then I saw the rest eventually (what the hell is with the Bounty Hunter's and Jester's sets?!).
Oh yeah, and speaking of trinkets? The Boss Trophies are worthless (not hyperbole; they are worthless). Maybe the first will be useful for a little more speed on someone for a few expeditions, but that's it.

If you really love Darkest Dungeon, it's worth trying this mistake of a campaign out on your second playthrough (the game actually warns you it'll ruin your experience if you switch the campaign on in your first run). Then it's up to you if you ever do it again.
People who love the way it infects the game, and gamer masochists, will love it forever and never turn it off (not even temporarily at the start of an estate).",76561198073592598,275,37,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

If you a new player to this series do yourself a favor and disable this dlc. You are definitely not ready for it as was I. I really enjoyed the original game. I never understood games like dark souls until I played this game. It kicks your ass hard. But it's that that makes me want to play more. And as a new player this dlc almost broke that love I had. Yes I said most of the problems are from me not being good enough but this is needed for new players to know or else they may refund the game or ignore it forever which is not something I want. First (I might have just been really unlucky but I mentioning it) every week you will get a event that basically just weakens all stress relief buildings not by much but it can get annoy because some of the more useful and horrible events are basically locked out of the game. Second you fix it by doing the first courtyard mission which was a really fun challenge especially the boss fight. However this causes and even greater issue. The creatures from the courtyard now show up as encounters in the rest of the game. Which cause one of if not the biggest issue in the dlc specially for newer players. The crimson curse. This was the worst thing to experience. The creatures are decently common I'd say you run into them once every 3-5 battles. They have insanely high resistances and life steal. But that wouldn't have been so bad. Because the curse is the worst thing to deal with. Almost every one of their attacks can give the curse. Which makes your heroes weaker to the point they die. The only way to fix this is finding blood. How do you get blood you ask. RNG or winning the fights with the creatures. This isn't a temporary solution though and some cursed heroes need one or two blood to keep them alive on the shortest mission. In order to get a more permanent fix you either need to take out the new boss which only comes on a specific event and only fights you when you have 2 or more cursed heroes. Not that much right. In the stagecoach yes but it needs to be on your main team. Yes half your team needs to be infected and only they get cured (not sure about that one though never won against him). Or you can try the more reliable solution and beat the veteran lv quest it has. Oh it's an epic length quest so it probably going give me 3-4 firewood to camp and... NOPE IT'S A ONE HUNDRED ROOM DUNGEON IN WHICH YOU NEED TO GET THROUGH 3 GATES WITH SPECIFIC KEYS WITH THERE OWN 3 BOSS WHILE FIGHTING ONLY ENEMIES THAT GIVE THE CURSE. AND ONE FINAL BOSS FIGHT AT THE END AND THEN EVERYONE IS CURED. When I start this quest I had maybe 2-3 of my heroes infected. By the time I got to the first gate I had 9. This game really need a warning to those who bought the dlc saying it's a difficulty tweak because holy I grew to hate this game as I play more with this dlc. However after reading more of the reviews from this I want to give it a recommendation because everyone has convinced me that I need to get better and not blame the game.

It pains me to give anything less than a good review for this DLC. I've done everything and have always been beside Redhook but this DLC really dropped the bal. It's like they took all the bad parts of DD and mistook it as the good parts. 

They ignored cries of the game beign too grindy and made the new dungeon require TONS of gridnign to even access. They ignored cries of the game having too much RNG and made a new disease that you can't prevent that will randomly kill people, is mostly unstoppable, and can just ruin runs that were going well where you did everythign correctly.

If you buy this for the Crimson Court you WILL be dissapointed. You will be forced to replay old portions of the game for AT MINIMUM 2 hours until you can access more than a quarter of the new content in the new dungeon. It's a tradgedy that they make you pay for somethign new when it's mostly focesed on old content.

If you get this I 100% suggest trying to mod out the invitation system completely. Hopefully someone creates that mod alleviates this terrible stain on such a good game.

However... even then you're stil left with the actual state of the Crimson Court itself. It's empty. The same rooms are recyled in all 4 runs. It's massive and has mostly hallways. And it will require multiple tries since you're very likely to have RNG make the new disease randomly take one of your heros away by just instantly killing them.

The new disease is unstoppable. It has trhe downsides of something as if it were balanced to be controllable but it isn't.In DD, you are punihsed for allowing bad things like Deaths Door to happen. However, this new disease is unpreventable and uncurable. This means that you have to deal with the downsides of something without even getting the chance to interact with it.

I was so happy for a new disease because I though I'd get toprevent it or slow it's spread somehow - or perhaps slow the symptoms. However all of it is RNG dependant.

[b]It astonishes me how thye centered this DLC on something that is the epitome of the 2 things that this game gets bad review/complaints for: RNG and HUGE grind.[/b]

If I wanted to play the old portion of the game for several days again I wouldn't have bought the DLC. Why do you think I bought it if I was just going to spend most of my time just trying to get a R~a~N~d~O~m invitation to drop just so I can even get a glimpse of more than one quarter of the new content?

So to dive right in we already know that Crimson Court is beautiful, perfectly narrated and so on.
The reason I don't recommend Crimson Court is that it burdens some of the worst aspects of the base game. *spoilers ahead*
First of all the crimson curse is just far too abundant. Second hit gave me the curse. It's just a constant nuisance, it's almost as though CC is a DLC debuff to your characters.
Now you have to manage your inventory to constantly bring/pick up blood making your inventory problems worse.
It's just another food - you may need 0 or 24. Who knows (I'm being a little extreme).
You will now have one less slot to pick up valuables/heirlooms.

Now I do LOVE the flagellant (op) and the districts are nice - but I would love some more 'low level' districts to balance out the overwhelming disgust of the Crimson Curse.
I enjoy the Crimson Court itself but the tedium of needing more blood than what I could ever hope to gather makes it less than favorable - I really wish it had some extra value (like just higher gold/trinket/heirloom rewards to balance out the curse to keep it simple).

I am not saying that it's too hard as I am enjoying a lot of the new fights. I feel like this DLC weighs too heavily on some of the worst aspects of the game without adding enough elsewhere.

Overall the crimson court is a really cool concept. The thematic part of it was really well done and it adds a great deal to the lore with things like vampires and gluttony which fit the game. The flagellant is a great character that really has no equivalent in terms of play style or personality. But they didn't have to make the mechanics of the crimson court so damn annoying. My biggest gripe with the crimson court is not the difficulty but how the game implements the difficulty. This DLC was made for the most hardcore of players that want to play the game for hundreds of hours on end and for those people this is a perfect DLC. It adds a lot of ways for characters to randomly die and will set you back. For those people who have the game completely mapped out it is great. For the casual player it is a nightmare. The wandering boss that it adds is nothing short of the hardest normal boss you can fight, which wouldn't be a problem if it also dropped good items which it does not. It also does not help that it is an unoriginal fight as well. The fight boils down to a much harder hag in almost every way. Turn one grab, turn 2 de-buff, turn 3 hit. rinse and repeat with some variation. It also pokes at the flaw in game design that is speed, with three turns it is almost impossible to use characters that need setup consistently as you will have almost no indication of when the boss is taking its turns. The crimson curse mechanic is also very random. Random chance to get it, random chance to spawn the boss, random chance to die from the curse while wasting, random chance to get bloodsucker enemies in any area of the map. If you have this DLC with the farmsted, the nuances of each zone are now overshadowed by the chance of 3 different random spawns that are completely out of your control bar what you do in the mission select screen. This was the collecter and shamblers job to begin with, but instead of a small chance that they spawn it is almost guaranteed that the crimson curse will make its way into your levels every mission (also don't forget you still have to deal with the two wandering bosses that are already in the game). With this DLC it is not important but crucial that you make multiple teams that will do well in the crimson court at the start of the game or you will feel the consequences of not giving the DLC your full attention. This DLC DEMANDS attention and will completely change how you should go about completing the game. This is why I feel it is terrible to anyone but the most seasoned players of the game. Even on the lower difficulties it punishes players for not acting in certain ways due to a lack of knowledge

In the end, was it fun to say all my characters I liked had aids, yes. Did I like having yet another map with leper supremacy, yes. Do I recommend this DLC to anyone but those who solely play on torchless hardest difficulty, no. If you are anything like me, difficulty alone is not enough for me to like something. I already had issues with things like multiple turns ignoring speed, how the first ~6 of my characters died on the first hit of deaths door and how random chance artificially inflates difficulty. I completely stopped playing torchless after a giant crit 1 shot Reynauld for 83 on full health and lost me the achievement making me restart my 50+ hours of game play. That is how most enemies in this DLC feel, and how most of the mechanics of this DLC work. If you like to gamble, this DLC will give you more dopamine than anything else in the game could, but IMO I don't have the time or care to constantly be punished for things that are out of my control. That happens in real life enough, I don't need it in my games as well.",76561198054677954,0,21,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

I love Darkest Dungeon (around 200h played and a positive review) but this DLC is garbage.

The flagellant is cool and unique, but everything else about this DLC is between 'annoying' and 'bullshit'.
The curse is just annoying to deal with, but it doesn't  add an interesting challenge. Just do some gathering quests when you are low on blood and that's it. Also, remember to bring blood if you have cursed heroes in the party. As if we didn't already have a dozen things to remember before every single mission.

The new enemies aren't bad, but putting them EVERYWHERE is retarded. At high infestation level, literally half encounters, on every single dungeon, are bloodsuckers. Gets old VERY VERY quickly and doesn't provide a significant challenge. Again, annoying. It kills the variety, both in enemies faced and in party composition.

The real challenge comes from the new bosses, but not in an interesting way. I only fought the baron so far and failed a few times. It looks like they simply decided to do what mediocre developers do: give him all sorts of unfair, artificial advantages with no interesting mechanics on top.

Disproportionately large HP pool, retardedly high crit chance, medium damage skill to hit the entire party, high damage single target skill (wich frequently crits for 20+) with bleed, stress and horror. And of course the bloodsucker skill to heal himself for 20ish HP.
All of the above, with THREE fucking actions per turn.
Basically a giant HP sponge hitting like a truck.
They tried to make this encounter interesting with the stupid pods, but they are largely irrelevant, unless you decide for some reason to break them all together.

So I can't recommend this DLC. It just tries to push the 'content' in your face at every step, but the real content is terrible, except for the new class. I'm not sure if I really want to see the other bosses, considering what they did with the first one.

So, the first time you enter the Courtyard level, you trigger an event which causes the Courtyard's enemies to begin appearing on other stages, gradually increasing in frequency over time. Normally, this would be fine, as the enemies have great designs and attacks. They're fairly tough, as they have very high speed and dodge stats, and slightly higher HP than some other standard mooks. The problem with this is in that they can afflict your characters with the Crimson Curse, which is a debuff that causes them to crave a specific item that you get from fighting these enemies and lowers their stats, and it will eventually kill them. I don't mind the enemies always getting to go first, it's an RPG and damage is expected, but nearly guaranteeing a hit eventually and giving my characters a debuff that can't be cured at the sanitarium is not so fun and engaging, especially since you can't even build your team to deal with it. 

But fine, I dealt with it. To cure this debuff, I had to kill the Baron. He wasn't super tough, but the map was obnoxiously long and you got no fire wood. There were locked doors everywhere, and I had to hunt for keys, while being constantly bombarded by these same enemies. This took a long time, it was mostly walking, and I did it in one run despite being able to leave and come back later, because I didn't want to fight more of these enemies just to get another invitation, which I would need to get back to the manor. It was then that I realized that to REALLY get rid of the Crimson Curse for good, I'd need to kill the Countess, because if I don't, the frequency of the Crimson Court enemies would gradually increase over time again. 

This makes things even worse, because that meant that I needed to do TWO MORE of these massive maps, with the last one being the same difficulty as the Darkest Dungeon. This means that for most people, you'd need to grind a max level team just to get rid of this frustrating mechanic. I recommend getting a mod to remove the Crimson Curse or something, because this DLC is pretty silly, aside from the added trinkets and characters.",76561198253335449,0,47,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

Now for the Baron! The ""Epic"" length may put people off, but they need to realise that the game saves your position when you leave the Baron's Courtyard. That way you can make repeated excursions clearing separate wings of the Baron's estate until you eventually confront the bloated fiend himself. Sure it is labyrinthine and the keys are hidden. The red key was harder to find for me than the blue and yellow keys. Definitely a brutal dungeon, but great gameplay there. I haven't even started the Viscount yet! The only nitpick I may have is waiting to find random Gatekeepers for Baron's invitations, but I had collected about 6 by week 35.

As for the curse itself, Blood Management is the name of the game. People need to use characters with the curse sparingly and the blood sparingly as well. Collecting some of the new very rare curse related trinkets early on greatly helps with the Blood Management.

These bloodsuckers give you a new disease, the Crimson Curse. The Crimson Curse essentially turns your heroes into vampires who must drink ""The Blood"" constantly in order to survive. If you fail to give them blood they will die. The only way to wipe out the Crimson Curse is by defeating one of the bosses in an over 100 room dungeon. The actual bosses are intense and exciting but the dungeon is just really long and obnoxious with little enemy variety. (Their are only 6 new enemies not including bosses)

The content is certainly there (unlike, ahem, certain Paradox DLCs) - you get a new region with all new mechanics, an interesting, highly-specialised hero, new dungeon types and bosses, and so on. The art style is excellent as usual, reminding me of Bloodborne's The Old Hunters DLC.  But the question you should be asking isn't ""is there enough content?"", but rather ""do you actually want to engage with this content?"".

The new dungeons are way too long. Level 3 of the Darkest Dungeon wasn't long enough for you? Well, you're in luck... kind of, because one does not simply walk into the Courtyard. Oh no, you have to wait for the RNG to bless you with an enemy that drops a... wait for it... invitation to a dungeon. And this enemy can escape if you don't kill it in time. Sounds fun?

You also cannot just try a few missions in the new Courtyard region, decide they aren't for you, and never go there again.

Middling
(this also includes things that are questionable but I don't actually consider bad in a vacuum, though they often become obnoxious combined with other things)
~ I do appreciate the variety

~ Almost every CC enemy has a stress attack, or just has free stress infliction on actual attacks, making stress management vastly more difficult.

~ The Crocodile boss is practically a troll boss, having a low-warning attack that can deal upwards of 20 damage to your entire, Apprentice-Difficulty party, likely immediately bringing most of them to death's door. With proper management this isn't an issue since you can prevent it, but it's a really bad ""haha gotcha"" for new players.

~ I have yet to encounter The Fanatic, I won't pass judgement on him

~ I'm unsure if the Cocoons replace normal curios or are added on top, if they're added on top then ignore this, if they replace then treat this as a Bad because oh my god there are so many of them and they are completely useless unless you are truly desperate for Blood.

Bad
- Crimson Curse is potentially the most obnoxious game mechanic I have experienced in a very long time. Incurable, permanent disease that debuffs hero stats significantly no matter what you do, causes stress events constantly, causes your heroes to attack each other constantly, etc. It's basically like permanently being Afflicted with a milder version of every Affliction combined, and then you can get Afflicted on top of it which makes a hero completely nonfunctional. It's so common that 3/4 of your roster will end up infected unless you dismiss heroes with it, which puts a massive strain on your roster and funding anyway. You're even punished for treating it because Bloodlust has a bunch of potentially serious negative effects it also can cause, forcing you to either deal with those or deal with the constant stress bombs from Craving.

- The CC enemies appearing in other regions trashes party comps in a way you can't really account or compensate for. They're all extremely resilient to Blight and Debuffs (and moderately resistant to stuns), greatly weakening those abilities because any given encounter could be replaced with CC enemies. No skills or quirks give bonuses against CC enemies either, as they're a unique type. They also almost all have super high dodge, meaning you need either dodge reduction skills or very high accuracy.

- CC enemies are extremely fast, almost guaranteed to go first, making it even more difficult to avoid getting your entire party infected, and partially nullifying the sense of urgency and depth I mentioned as a good thing because enemies will always go so fast you can't take them out before they become a problem.

- Gatekeepers are so difficult to actually kill before they inflict a free 20+ stress on your entire party and then leave that it's infuriating.

- CC greatly diminishes the usefulness of the Shieldbreaker and Plague Doctor (and somewhat the Grave Robber), as now you can get heavily blight-resistant enemies anywhere. 

The thing that finally pushed me to write this up was that I had an absolutely horrible apprentice-level dungeon venture that was completely caused by CC. Very first encounter was CC enemies, only one path so I can't retreat unless I abandon mission. Gatekeeper goes first with their obscene speed, immediately inflicts 20 stress and wrecks my party order, making me unable to do anything with two of my units. Two mosquitos inflict CC on two of my party members instantly. I kill one of them and Bleed the standing enemy with 20% protection (I'll remember names eventually). I miss a Bleed and Dodge debuff on the Gatekeeper. Gatekeeper goes first on round 2, immediately flees for free 20 stress on whole party and filling the field with more mosquitos. Entire party gets CC'd, Plague Doctor gets hyper-focused to death's door (thankfully doesn't die...), Plague Doctor also Afflicted despite coming in at zero stress.

Second encounter. Leper attacks teammates for 8+ damage two turns in a row, then passes turn on the third turn. Cascade of CC stress events causing my entire party to gain over 30 stress in two turns despite not being hit with any stress attacks. I flee battle and abandon mission before plague doctor has a heart attack and dies. Dismiss entire party because they're all level 0 or 1 and all have CC.

Could I have played this better? Almost certainly, I don't claim to be good at this game. But this still felt like a completely overwhelming combination of events I couldn't have ""properly"" reacted to, all caused by elements of this DLC that I already didn't like. 

Conclusion

Buy this DLC on discount. You can disable Crimson Curse as a mechanic with mods which makes the rest of the DLC tolerable, or use mods to make CC far less annoying and more feature-rich. If you just want the Flagellant and/or Districts you can also do that. Do NOT use the full package for a first playthrough, only use Flagellant and Districts if anything. I'd recommend doing your second run on standard difficulty, and then drop back down to easy for your first run with this DLC if you do intend to use the entire thing.",76561198044470633,717,31,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

On the one, there is a slew of new base upgrades, excellent new zone and enemies, good new items and bosses, and a truly excellent new class.

On the other, the blood curse mechanic.... sucks. It makes you want to kill off any ally who contracts it, and makes the fights with any of the blood enemies more stressful than fun.

To stack with the above frustration, there is a new global infection level, which increases over time and has a chance to replace any enemy encounter in any zone with that of the infect-happy bloodsuckers. This makes the blight classes (poor plague doctor) almost entirely worthless when the infestation is high, as even the zones with normally blight-weak enemies will have half their armies replaced with vampire moquitoes with near blight immunity. Which throws a lot of balance out of whack, and in some ways artifically improves the utility of the bleed-friendly included class.

Thankfully, completing the story missions offers plenty of cure opportunities, and respites from the overwhelming blood beasty swarms. That alone makes this new mechanic livable.

The general idea behind it is solid - a vampiric curse your characters can catch, and which needs to be managed or it can spiral out of control. In my opinion dealing with it isn't as difficult as others have made it out to be, and I personally find it a fun additional bit of management. However it's not without its flaws.

The curse has multiple states depending on how ""hungry"" the character is for Blood, the new consumable for controlling the curse. These different states have different buffs and debuffs associated with them. While some of the buffs are handy, make no mistake that the curse is *never* a good thing to have. There are some random musings on the wiki that says the ""true power"" of the Crimson Curse comes out when in Bloodlust, which increases your character's speed and gives a sizable +25% damage boost. However it's a bit daft to imply there's any real benefit here, because when in Bloodlust your character has a high chance of acting without your instructions, dealing stress damage to the entire party, changing the party's order, denying buffs/heals, or attacking fellow party members. These occur enough where they most certainly do not make the +25% damage worth it, since about 50% of the time your character is going to just do something against the plan. In other words, there is really no upside to having the Crimson Curse - just different ways it can mess with you.

While I do like the general mechanic of the curse, I can't say I enjoyed the new Courtyard levels. They are very long, but not in the tense exploratory sense like the Darkest Dungeon stages - rather they just feel like a tedious march. The length isn't where the tedium comes in, it's the back tracking - there are multiple dead ends and locked doors requiring keys found at other dead ends. This means you'll spend an hour working your way one direction, only to realize you actually should have been working a different direction and have to backtrack to the other side of the level through already cleared hallways. I think the intent here was to make it so you had to carefully manage your characters lust for blood during these missions, but it's just kind of.....boring. You could reference a map on the wiki and have an easier time, but I chose to go in ""clean"" and see what happened. It probably wasn't really worth it in retrospect though, spending more time navigating the Courtyard wasn't really a highlight of my playthrough.

The Fanatic mini-boss is a cool concept and I don't mind a tough fight, but he is a very risky fight and the payoff for killing him is way out of proportion to the risk for taking him on. There's basically no reason you would willingly want to face him, whereas the Shambler, Collector, and Thing from the Stars mini-bosses all have considerable payoffs you'll get only from them, to the point where you would at times actually want to hunt them down. You'll never want to hunt for the Fanatic though - again maybe that's the point, but it just doesn't feel right compared to the balance of the rest of the game. It would have been far better if he had a few intensely powerful trinkets you could *only* get from a fight with him, rather than just being a source of random trinkets you could also just get from many other places in the game.

The new Crimson Court trinkets are fun, and the way they get additional bonuses when both worn means some of them can really make a great combo. However I found that I tended to use the trinkets from the base game quite a bit more often with few exceptions. Some pairings are very close to being fantastic but still fall short of more traditional pairings, which is I think a real shame.

That's a fair amount of negativity, but overall I did enjoy the addition to the game. It's just that while I would give vanilla Darkest Dungeon a solid A, I'd give this maybe a C+. A passing grade, but nothing to brag about.",76561197993652586,0,10,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

In fact, I love it so much, I've been exposing myself to additional heartbreak and insanity by trying to nab that ""On the Old Road we Found Redemption"" achievement, second hardest achievement to get.

HOWEVER: The Crimson Court is even too much hassel even for me. Don't get me wrong: conceptually and thematically it's gorgeous. New mobs, art assets, even a couple of ""Event"" bosses that are really cool. But, it's not implemented well. As has been mentioned by numerous others who are in a similar boat, a lot of the mechanics added to CC are not well balanced with the previous experience. In short: EVERYONE is going to have the Crimson Curse, which means EVERYONE is going to have permenant de-buffs, and EVERYONE is going to be in a permenant state of affliction (plus a second affliction because stress will rise in leaps and bounds), and EVERYONE is going to be aching for their ""red liquor"" hit, with additional de-buffs and additional stress and so on until the whole game is untenable.

Blood mechanic, Balancing of the Crimson Court


The blood mechanic is a terrible idea. It wasn't bad enough that your characters suffered from negative traits and corruption, no blood mechanic made things much worse. If you do not have blood your character get weaker and sometimes passes or changes places disrupting your formation, once he even stunned a fellow hero or corrupted them. There is no way to prevent it, except blood...which drops by RNG. 

If that wasn't enough you get soon access to the Crimson Court. The problem is, it is unbalanced as hell. Here an example:
The starting dungeon seems to be no random but fix. It is marked for beginner characters and short. Which is both terribly wrong. If you go in, the dungeon is the length of LONG dungeons...and you cannot rest. That is not the worst, though. In order to complete it, your poor level 1 characters have to pass a monster with 135 hitpoints, has aoe corrupt, hits like a truck, can self-buff and heal and attacks quite often. 
Which is your certain doom because the other monsters in the Crimson Court will have beat up your party already and you will have corruption.

CONS: The Crimson Court/vampire enemies spawn far to frequently outside of the Courtyard dungeon track. This makes Bleed damage much too effective. Particularly when you have the Shieldbreaker as well - Shieldbreakers become near worthless due to the prevelance of the vampire enemies across all dungeon types. Additionally, their presence makes the curse much too virulent. I've never been able to cure the curse either, so you end up in a situation where your more experienced party members are all infected. You then get the Fanatic spawning and are forced into a boss fight. Any progression becomes impossible. The vampires become the complete focus of the game and inescapable.",76561197982930829,0,5,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

But it is a really good DLC filled with interesting lore and secrets as well as beautifully nightmarish enemies and backgrounds. It adds another major level of complexity and challenge to the game that some would find too much. That is why THIS DLC IS NOT FIT FOR A FIRST PLAY THROUGH. In fact I would be wary of even doing the crimson court now with my over 100,000 hours of DD in total (dd1 dd2 BR). 

The major cons as listen above do (and will) be very challenging and difficult, but I mean thats kinda the point. A lot of people forget what game they are playing when they complain about it. Yes you are meant to be struggling, yes it should be stressful and horrifying, because the game is a beast that you need to hold on for dear life and conquer it though at any second it could throw you off to the beginning again.

It's new content, sure. But it's not particularly good new content. I recommend anyone that picks this up only activates the DLC once they're in comfortable late game where their hero and trinket economy is solid and they're not lacking in any of the important building upgrades. Don't activate it too late either when you've beaten the game, because the DLC requires grinding to resume access to the courtyard after a failed or postponed attempt at one of the ""epic"" level dungeons. I ended up just quitting the DLC after a particularly frustrating death in one of the later DLC dungeons, simply because I didn't want to grind out more of the normal dungeons to get invitations. The new enemies are particularly infuriating, they're ridiculously fast and will almost always take priority over your heroes, even when boosted with speed trinkets and quirks. On top of this they have high dodge, sizable health, and some of them are effectively stun immune. Basically, getting hit, and through that obtaining curse on your heroes is inevitable regardless of how much you try to compensate for avoiding it. The curse itself is an annoying affliction-lite but for the sake of brevity I'll leave it at that, other reviewers have probably explained it in detail.

Some positives: soundtrack is nice, visuals are amazing, but that's about it. 

I would not recommend buying this DLC at full price, color of madness is much better content and is less frustrating as a whole.",76561198019542583,247,14,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00

People complain about how badly Crimson Curse debuffs a hero, but if you [b] read [/b] what it changes instead of just checking that it has a few [i] -minuses [/i] on stats and only one [i] +plus [/i], you would see that it's [b]+1 speed[/b] for just a few -5% to [i] useless [/i] debuff checks, so it's actually beneficial. (If you think -5% hp means anything, the bonus speed is saving you much more than that).

If you haven't grasped the basics of this game, [u] just enable this mod when you're comfortable [/u] and have a well-developed estate and roster.
Crimson Court is gonna [b] affect [/b] your game, and you are going to have to play around that dlc 
[i] (for example suffering through the first weeks of plague town events to build a stronger hero roster, so you can go into crimson court with your best squad) [/i]
The Curse will affect you in a positive way (if you managed blood well) or in a negative way (if you didn't). [b] Heroes affected by the curse will be stronger, but if you have too many of them you won't have enough blood to keep them alive. [/b]

If you build your team without any thought to it you are going to have a bad time.
People complain that mosquitoes have 10 spd and there is no counterplay to Crimson Curse because of that XD
10 spd is easily achievable even on lvls 1-3 if you  [b] choose [/b] classes that are slightly faster (shieldbreaker, grave robber) which will  [b] oneshot [/b] bloodsuckers, and that's without <speed/dmg> altering quirks or trinkets (on NG+ with  [b] +20% hp  [/b] enemies).
Of course, sometimes you will roll low spd, and [i] risk [/i] getting cursed but that's the point, you can't always cheese your way through the game with a simple knowledge check.


Few tips and info:
- Holy water adds gives disease resistance, you can use it before/in battle with bloodsuckers or at the end of the quest (it will count towards random disease check)
- Disease charm is a common trinket that for just -2 dodge gives +20% disease resist
- Riposte and especially Highwayman is strong against crocodilian miniboss (crocodilian hits the whole party almost every turn and has 2 moves per round) and HWM can hit all ranks
- Two of flagellant abilities can only be used when he is below 40% hp so he benefits a lot from swapping skills depending on his health/stress
- You can only catch crimson curse once, so just use affected heroes in Courtyard

I consider myself to be an intermediate DD player (I beat the vanilla game), and decided to go into this thing blind, and from the start of a campaign. The experience is terrible. You trudge along in an absolutely gigantic map that's full of dead ends/backtracking, and when you get to the end, you face a boss that is CLEARLY too hard for the quest's level. And it's not like the game gives you a real choice of going there or not: it forces you to do the first quest by giving you a recurring town event that hampers you, and when you start getting infections it drops IMO way too little blood to keep you feeling safe for your infected heroes. My recommendation to anyone who purchases this is to either read up on everything on the wiki to prepare adequately, or to only activate the courtyard on an endgame save, and the fact that I have to make these recommendations IMO speaks of poor design.",76561198029168573,0,3,0,0,,1970-01-01T00:00:00+00:00
